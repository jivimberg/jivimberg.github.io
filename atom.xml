    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a member of the Platform team, one of my responsibilities is to plan and execute large-scale migrations. These pose a unique challenge: how to get people to complete some tasks without any authority over them.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>I will focus on large-scale changes in which multiple teams must update their code to complete the migration. An automated workflow that submits PRs might work better for minor changes like updating library versions. But for anything more complex than that, you&rsquo;ll need to enlist the help of the codebase owner, as they are the ones who know how to test and deploy the required changes.</p>

<p>The problem is that migrations are not fun. Nobody wakes up in the morning saying, &ldquo;Today is a great day to do some migrating.&rdquo; They are like brushing your teeth or eating your veggies; you do it because you have to. Your job is to get multiple teams to do it, sometimes even the whole company, and they must complete it before some deadline.</p>

<p>If you want migrations to be completed, the right incentives need to be in place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Management has to commit to making it happen, and there needs to be alignment on how the migration is prioritized against other tasks. This doesn&rsquo;t mean it always has to be the highest priority; it means people have to be on the same page regarding its priority.</li>
<li>Developers need to understand why some change is necessary. What are the benefits of migrating, and what are the risks of not doing so.</li>
<li>The culture needs to reward migration efforts. This might sound vague, but it looks like this in practice: the work is acknowledged in public forums such as town halls and all-hands, and people making it happen are rewarded.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Before you start: Appoint a Migration Leader</h2>

<p>One key requirement for a successful migration is to appoint a &ldquo;Migration Leader,&rdquo; an IC or PM who acts as a liaison for the migration. Their job is to plan, coordinate, and drive the migration to completion.</p>

<h2>Divide Migration Into 4 Stages</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2024-03-15/migration-stages.png"></p>

<h3>1. Planning</h3>

<p>The first step is to answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What needs to be done? Why?</li>
<li>Who needs to do it?</li>
<li>How to do it? (Migration steps)</li>
<li>When?</li>
</ol>


<p>The <em>What</em> and <em>Why</em> should be easy to answer. It is crucial to capture and communicate <em>why</em> we are embarking on this migration. Devs are practical, purpose-driven individuals; explaining why something needs to happen will help you convince them to do it. Sweeten the pill by mentioning the advantages the new thing provides, if any.</p>

<p>Make a list of affected repositories that need to be migrated and identify their owners. The goal is to gauge the scope of the migration and identify the teams that will need to be engaged to make it happen. Dependency analysis and codebase search can be powerful tools for this task. At this point, it is also helpful to capture other codebase details that affect the migration instructions, such as language, number of usages that need to be migrated, etc.</p>

<p>Next, we move to the <em>How</em>. Start by performing the migration yourself (on one of your team repositories if possible) and document every step. Once that&rsquo;s done, do a few white-glove migrations for other teams: pick a handful of repositories from other teams and pair with them to run the migration. Using the list from the previous step, select a varied sample of repositories to cover the different scenarios users might face. Use these experiences to refine the migration documentation.</p>

<p>Documentation is integral to the smooth execution of a migration. In a large-scale migration, it&rsquo;s expected that different scenarios will arise for different users. Instead of trying to cram everything into the same guide, create different guides and make sure to point users to the guide that is relevant to them.</p>

<p>Based on what you learned from the previous steps, you should have a good sense of the size and complexity of the migration. Using this information, set a deadline for completion. Give the teams a few cycles to add the migration to their plans and execute. At this stage, the <em>When</em> is just an estimation, but it is important to have a date for which to aim.</p>

<h3>2. Kick-off the Migration Campaign</h3>

<p>By now, your migration documents are ready, and a few teams have gone through the process. You&rsquo;ve done your homework and are ready to kick off the migration campaign.</p>

<p>For best results, the migration kick-off should be done before planning for the next cycle starts. That way, teams can allocate time to it instead of making it a mid-cycle distraction.</p>

<p>Kick off by broadcasting the intent of the migration and the expected timelines through org-wide communication. Next, engage the specific teams that need to do the work. The rule of thumb is that the wider the audience, the less granular the information. So, for example, for a company-wide email, it is enough to state <em>What</em> and <em>When</em>, whereas for specific teams, you should also include details on How and links to the actual documentation.</p>

<p>To avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect">Bystander effect</a>, identify a single point of contact for each repository that needs to be migrated. If possible, have it be the same person for all the repos owned by a team so they can reuse the knowledge.</p>

<p>Create a new Slack channel and add all these people. This will be your fine-grain communication channel. It is also where people can collaborate, provide feedback, learn from each other, and ask questions.</p>

<h3>3. The Bulk of the Migration Happens</h3>

<p>Now, you go into reactive mode. It&rsquo;s time for the teams to do their part.</p>

<p>Your job is to follow up with regular updates and keep tabs on which repositories have already migrated. The best way to do this is through a dashboard. You don&rsquo;t need something fancy; a simple spreadsheet would do (but if you can spare the resources, a little flair never hurts). The main questions the dashboard should answer are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What&rsquo;s the overall progress?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s missing?</li>
</ol>


<p>Allow users to slice the data by org/team. Showing a leaderboard comparing migration progress across orgs/teams is an effective way of encouraging people to take action. Nobody wants to be the cause of their team being at the bottom of the leaderboard.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2024-03-15/migration-dashboard.png"></p>

<p>Be sure to reserve some time for office hours and support for teams that have questions or get stuck during the migration. Unforeseen issues will come up, so you better reserve some capacity to deal with them if you want to see the migration through.</p>

<h3>4. Dealing with Stragglers</h3>

<p>Most teams have already migrated. You only have a handful of projects left, but they seem to be stuck and barely making any progress.</p>

<p>This is the make-or-break stage. This is where migrations go to die. Don&rsquo;t let this happen!</p>

<p>Go through the list of pending teams and treat each as a problem to debug. Does the team know they have to migrate? Have they looked at the instructions? Do they understand what steps they have to perform? Are they blocked on something? Do they have the resources to complete it on time?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to don your enabler hat. Identify what&rsquo;s causing the delay and unblock the team. At times, you might have to sit down with the team and debug their code. Other times, you&rsquo;ll need to talk to managers and PMs to have the migration prioritized. Do whatever it takes, and don&rsquo;t give up!</p>

<p>There will always be stragglers; there&rsquo;s no way around it. The only thing you can do is identify them early. Pay attention to the signs: a team going quiet for too long, the migration being pushed off for multiple quarters, a repository with no clear owner, etc. All these things should trigger your spidey sense and bring you to action.</p>

<h2>Ending Note: Build Trust</h2>

<p>One final piece of advice: build trust with your users. Developers need to know that if a platform initiates a migration, it&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s really worth it and that you have taken all the required steps to make it as seamless as possible for them.</p>

<p>Be understanding about people&rsquo;s time and priorities. Chances are this won&rsquo;t be your last time working with them, so don&rsquo;t jeopardize your relationship to hit a deadline. And more generally, don&rsquo;t be a dick.</p>

<p>May all your migrations complete!</p>

    <updated>2023-09-22T10:00:27-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2023/09/22/the-way-we-talk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m an immigrant desperately trying to fit in. Maybe it&rsquo;s one more way of keeping the imposter syndrome at bay. Whatever the reason, I&rsquo;ve always been low-key obsessed with software development lingo. I&rsquo;d go through meetings dropping <em>principles</em> and <em>laws</em> every chance I got. I&rsquo;d lurk Slack channels waiting for a chance to pounce on a conversation to say &ldquo;That&rsquo;d make it worse based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brooke&rsquo;s Law</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;You&rsquo;re falling for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>!&rdquo;. Because I thought that gave me street cred. Same way I&rsquo;d cover my laptop with stickers to showcase all the frameworks I knew and the conferences I&rsquo;ve been to (but only if it was a modern framework and a <em>&ldquo;cool&rdquo;</em> conference). Just last week, I <a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2023/09/04/the-inverse-conway-maneuver/">wrote a post</a> teaching an imaginary audience about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&rsquo;s Law</a> and posted it on the social network for professional narcissists.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>But it&rsquo;s not just an egotistical affectation. I honestly believe there are some benefits to knowing these laws and principles by name. Labeling things helps us <em>think</em> about them. I don&rsquo;t fully understand why; I&rsquo;d need a major in Philosophy to explain this properly, but all I know is Computer Science, so to me, using a name for a complex idea feels like defining a variable. It gives us a handle to refer to it without worrying about the internals. That way, our brains can work with this concept (comparing it, finding applications, counter-examples, etc.) without needing to delve into its definition&rsquo;s nuances every time. Similar to how we can pass around a reference to an object and work with it without caring for its implementation.</p>

<p>Giving things a name may also help us communicate more efficiently among peers. <strong>We can better use of the communication bandwidth by referring to a complex concept by its name.</strong> It&rsquo;s the difference between saying:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;We should be careful about making that change! This service is widely use, so there&rsquo;ll probably be some users relying on such behavior even if we made no promises about it, and it&rsquo;s not documented on the API&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be careful and consider <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum&rsquo;s Law</a>&rdquo;.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2023-09-22/hyrums-law-xkcd.png" width="400"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, when speaking the words, we cannot include the hyperlink as I did above. <strong>The shortcut only works if both persons known what <em>&ldquo;Hyrum&rsquo;s Law&rdquo;</em> means.</strong> It&rsquo;s as they say: &ldquo;It takes too to dance that ballroom dance originated in Buenos Aires, characterized by marked rhythms and postures and abrupt pauses&rdquo;. You might think this is no big deal. After all, if the listener doesn&rsquo;t know the meaning, they can always interrupt the conversation and ask. But you&rsquo;d be surprised how rare this is. Admitting to one&rsquo;s ignorance in front of your peers takes a fair amount of courage and trust. The more people in a meeting, the harder it is to ask for clarification. Mention <em>&ldquo;Fincher&rsquo;s Law&rdquo;</em> in a hundred person town-hall, and I can guarantee you not one person will ask what it means. Even though they don&rsquo;t know about it because I just made it up. For the following few minutes, half of them will be running Google searches on the side while trying to keep up with the rest of the presentation. The other half was already browsing their Amazon wishlists, half-listening.</p>

<p> There&rsquo;s an even worse scenario: When both parties know what a term means, but their definitions are not quite the same. The last project I worked on was delayed for a few days because the front-end and back-end engineers (aka me) thought their respective definitions of &ldquo;upstream service&rdquo; was the correct one. <strong>There are few things more pernicious to software than uncheck assumptions.</strong></p>

<p>Another reason to avoid technical jargon is that it contributes to gate-keeping. <strong>Talking difficult might improve communication (providing you avoid the pitfalls mentioned above), but it makes it harder for a newcomer to understand what the hell is going on.</strong> This applies to everything: a new junior developer who just joined the team, the documentation you write for your products, the README file on an open-source project, etc. The more lingo you use, the more people you leave out.</p>

<p>To sum up, if you&rsquo;re going to use technical jargon or cite a law or principle, make sure that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your audience understands what you&rsquo;re talking about.</li>
<li>Your definition and the audience definition match.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re not talking to (or writing for) newcomers.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re not speaking for a big audience.</li>
</ol>

    <link href="http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2023/09/04/the-inverse-conway-maneuver/"/>
    <updated>2023-09-04T10:07:02-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2023/09/04/the-inverse-conway-maneuver</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first joined the Netflix Platform team circa 2020, the Observability offering was composed of a series of tools serving different purposes. There was <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-atlas-netflixs-primary-telemetry-platform-bd31f4d8ed9a">Atlas</a> for metrics, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/edgar-solving-mysteries-faster-with-observability-e1a76302c71f">Edgar</a> for distributed tracing, Radar for Logs and <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/improved-alerting-with-atlas-streaming-eval-e691c60dc61e">Alerts</a>, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/lumen-custom-self-service-dashboarding-for-netflix-8c56b541548c">Lumen</a> for dashboards, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/telltale-netflix-application-monitoring-simplified-5c08bfa780ba">Telltale</a> for app health, etc. It was a portfolio of about 20 different apps. Big and small, ranging from business-specific tools to analyze playback sessions to <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/java-in-flames-e763b3d32166">low-level tools for CPU profiling</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The Observability org was composed of three different teams. Each team had a mix of <em>front-end</em>, <em>back-end</em> and <em>full-stack</em> engineers. We also had one <em>designer</em> and one <em>PM</em> shared across the three teams. Each team was further subdivided into sub-teams of two to four engineers working on a specific sub-domain.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2023-09-04/observability-org-structure-1.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>It was no coincidence that this org structure produced <em>a set of independent apps</em>. That&rsquo;s the kind of architecture we&rsquo;d expect based on Conway&rsquo;s Law:</p>

<blockquote><p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&rsquo;s communication structure.</p>

<p><em>Melvin E. Conway</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Simply put, the system&rsquo;s architecture will be shaped like the org that produced it. This is because, to build a complex system, people must communicate to ensure the different pieces fit well together. <strong>Therefore, the design that emerges will be a map of the communications paths in the organization.</strong></p>

<p>Netflix&rsquo;s approach to building software further intensified this. Netflix embraces the <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249">Full Cycle Development</a>; this means teams are fully responsible for all the stages of the software lifecycle, from Design to Operate and Support.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2023-09-04/full-developer-lifecycle.png" width="480" title="`The empowered full cycle developer`" ></p>

<p>We were organized as <a href="https://noeldykes.medium.com/what-we-can-learn-from-the-netflix-culture-deck-as-business-leaders-ed35ed8c0689#:~:text=Highly%20Aligned%2C%20Loosely%20Coupled,are%20clear%2C%20understood%20and%20focused.">highly aligned, loosely coupled</a> teams with a high level of independence. ICs wholly owned every aspect of their work, from tech stack choices to which ticketing platform to use to track bugs. Netflix provides a recommended set of tools (known as &ldquo;paved path&rdquo;) but doesn&rsquo;t mandate their adoption. Each team is free to pick whatever tools and practices suit them best.</p>

<blockquote><p>Netflix has a “paved road” set of tools and practices that are formally supported by centralized teams. We don’t mandate adoption of those paved roads but encourage adoption by ensuring that development and operations using those technologies is a far better experience than not using them.</p>

<p><em>Extract from <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249">Full Cycle Development blog post</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>This produced a set of heterogeneous apps to serve the observability needs of the company. Each team would focus on its own sub-domain and individual products to deliver the best possible experience. And users were happy with the result. At least for a while&hellip;</p>

<p>By 2020, we started hearing a new kind of complaint. Users were beginning to get frustrated with the disjointed experience we provided for troubleshooting. <strong>Debugging a particular issue required them to replicate the same query across multiple tools and jump between tabs to assemble the pieces.</strong> To troubleshoot effectively, users had to be proficient with each tool and know when to use one or the other. To make matters worse, the different apps' documentation was scattered across multiple wikis, and we hadn&rsquo;t done a great job teaching users about new tools and features. It also didn&rsquo;t help that each app implemented its own base components (such as date pickers or query builders) with subtle variations. The required functionality was there, but it was only accessible to power users, and even then, having a comprehensive view of an issue took quite a bit of effort.</p>

<p>Our knee-jerk reaction to the feedback was adding deep links across apps so that users could jump to a different tool, taking the query context with them. This would make it easier to flow from one tool to the next when required. To make this happen, we had to start talking across the teams to align on a standard to send and receive contextual information through the links. Even something as trivial as this took us multiple meetings to agree on a standard that&rsquo;d satisfy the needs of all apps of the portfolio.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2023-09-04/observability-org-structure-2.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>Soon, we realized links were not going to cut it. We were also getting frustrated with how long it took us to coordinate these changes across teams. The links made the fact that we had some overlap between tools quite obvious. For example, you could pull all log messages for a given request in Edgar, but you&rsquo;d see them on Edgar&rsquo;s own log viewer component, which wasn&rsquo;t as powerful at Radar&rsquo;s. With deep linking, users could click the log message and see it on Radar, but at the cost of losing the request context, which only made sense on Edgar.</p>

<p>We came to the realization that if we wanted to provide a cohesive observability story we&rsquo;d need a single application that lets users interrogate multiple data sets at once. A place where they could observe their systems from different angles without having to jump through various hoops.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2023-09-04/observability-org-structure-3.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>We knew what kind of architecture we were going for, and based on Conway&rsquo;s Law we knew it would be hard to achieve it with the current org structure. So before we even discussed how we would implement anything, before we even knew if we were creating a new tool, a whole platform, or buying some ready-made solution, management made one decision. They pulled an Inverse Conway Maneuver and re-orged the teams. <strong>They re-shape the org structure to match the design solution we were going for, creating the communication paths required (and severing the ones not needed) to facilitate the work.</strong> And that is how the Explore team was born.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2023-09-04/observability-org-structure-4.jpg" width="750"></p>

<p>With this new structure, communication was optimized to produce a unified experience that&rsquo;d include all existing features across logs, metrics, traces, alerts, and dashboards. The trade-off was that now the back-end for any given vertical lived on a different team. <strong>This implies less communication between front-end and back-end engineers, making working on features requiring alignment between both parts slower.</strong> Management considered before doing the re-org, and decided the cost was acceptable because the goal of unification was a higher priority on our roadmap.</p>

<p>The takeaways here are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The org structure limits the design solutions an org can produce for a given system&rsquo;s architecture. This is Conway&rsquo;s Law.</li>
<li>If you know which architecture you aim for, you can adapt the org structure to facilitate arriving at your goal. This is known as the Inverse Conway Maneuver.</li>
<li>You might need different org configurations during the lifetime of a system, depending on what your goals are at the time.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to consider the trade-offs of choosing any given org structure, understanding which communication paths are being optimized and which ones de-prioritized, and how that affects the flow of work.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the door to my in-laws’ apartment.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2023-08-15/door.jpg" width="450"></p>

<p>You can safely ignore the puppy; it’s only there for SEO purposes. Focus instead on that thing on the wall, marked by the orange arrow. That is a motion-sensor light switch, the kind that turns the light on when you walk by. Only this one doesn’t because it works like shit. You must wave your hand in front of it, almost touching it, for the lights to come on.</p>

<p>As you can see in the picture, this sensor is roughly placed at the same level a light switch would be. Because of this, when people reach out in the dark, they end up activating the malfunctioning sensor. This is what we call graceful degradation of service. The sensor is essentially being used as a touch button. <strong>The motion-sensing functionality doesn’t work, but the system as a whole still works: people are able to turn on the lights when they need them.</strong> If the sensor had been placed somewhere else, such as at knee level or on the ceiling, the system would not have degraded gracefully. Things would work as long as the sensor is functioning correctly, but as soon as it’s busted, there’d be no way of turning on the lights. People would reach out in the dark and find nothing. Placing the sensor on the ceiling would also make the whole system harder to maintain, as you’d need a ladder every time you need to service it.</p>

<p>I don’t think anybody thought about graceful degradation when installing the switch. The motion sensor was most likely retrofitted after the fact, repurposing the hole previously used for a regular light switch. We could say that, in this case, the property of graceful degradation comes from leveraging a pre-existing user behavior. We could distill this learning into a product design rule that reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>When introducing a new feature, leverage existing user workflows instead of disrupting them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let’s illustrate this with an example. Not too long ago, Google launched their <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9116836?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">Smart Compose</a> feature for Gmail. The way it works is you start writing your email and suddenly a grayed-out text appears, trying to guess your next few words. If you like the suggestion, you press <code>tab</code>, and the caret jumps to the end of the line saving you a few keystrokes and leaving you wondering what sort of witchcraft Google is using to read your mind.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2023-08-15/gmail-smart-compose.gif"></p>

<p>Now, Google could have designed this feature in many different ways. It could, for example, open a popup menu with multiple options letting the user select the best one from the list the way <a href="https://presage.sourceforge.io/">this tool</a> does:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2023-08-15/gprompter.jpg"></p>

<p>This approach might seem more powerful at first glance because it gives the user multiple options instead of just one. But it has a huge disadvantage: it disrupts the user workflow. Picture this: You’re redacting an essay. You think of a sentence and start writing. Midway through a menu pops up designed to look like it’s on top of what you’re doing. Your hands stop typing. Your eyes dart through the popup content, read the first one, jump to the next line, read the second one, etc. You consider all the options and decide to go with the 4th one. Your hands jump to the arrow keys, and you click click click until the one you want is highlighted, then click once more to select it. All of this happens in a matter of milliseconds. And yet it is enough to break your flow. By contrast, Google’s design, users are offered a single option presented inline, as if the text were already written. With the grayed-out text shown in our visual pathway, the eyes naturally flow to the end of the sentence. We can accept the suggestion with just a single keystroke; if we do, our eyes are already in the right place to continue writing.</p>

<p>You might think Google’s design choice is obviously better and that I’m just cherry-picking a needlessly convoluted example as a straw man. And maybe you’re right. <strong>But keep in mind that design, when done right, is invisible.</strong> And what might seem like an obvious solution once you’ve seen it can be hard to come up with when you’re thinking a feature from scratch.</p>

<p>Figuring out the right way to introduce new functionality without disrupting user workflows takes dedication and practice. Often we developers get worked up about the new capability we’re introducing and forget to consider how it fits into the existing user journey. This happened to me not so long ago at Netflix. We were working on a new tool that’d let users discover and analyze correlated system failures that could be causally related. That is, if service A is going <em>Boop!</em> and service B is also going <em>Boop!</em> and we know service A calls service B then there’s a good chance those two events might be related. In some cases, we can even venture that one symptom might be caused by the other, establishing a causal relationship between the signals based on the requests’ call paths. We were super excited to put this new functionality in users’ hands. We were so bullish about it that we envisioned it being the first step in the troubleshooting journey. Users would start by analyzing their service anomalous metric in the context of the overall system health. We created a new tool to surface this kind of relationship between services and took a few iterations to design how we would overlay service health data on this new visualization. What we failed to realize is that we were introducing a whole new way of troubleshooting an incident. <strong>Asking users to learn a new way of doing things is always a tough sell.</strong> Especially when there’s an outage and things are on fire, users would systematically trust their muscle memory and revert to their battle-tested tools and dashboards.</p>

<p>Instead, we should have emulated the guy that installed that motion sensor in my in-laws' apartment. Rather than introducing a whole new tool, present whatever insight we can gather as part of the existing user workflow. For example, if a developer receives an alert from a failing metric on Service A, we could include any other metrics we think might be related in that same alert. Enriching the alert with additional context giving users a hint on where to look next. Or if they’re looking at a dashboard and notice an anomalous metric, we could then surface a message saying: “Hey, by the way, Service B is also failing in a similar way; you may want to check it”.</p>

<p>Instead of adopting an <em>“If you build it, they will come”</em> approach we should have <a href="https://medium.com/mule-design/meeting-users-where-they-are-624bc0caa83a">met users where they were at</a>. Presenting key insights in the context of their troubleshooting session and letting them jump to the new tool if they want to dig deeper. <strong>A system built this way would degrade gracefully</strong>: If the correlation service is down or the suggestion is not good, users can still keep troubleshooting the same way they do today.</p>

<p>I added a few things here and there, but most of the stuff is taken from the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/platform-teams-stuff-done.html">original article</a>, so if you care about this topic I recommend you check it out!</p>

<p>I found particularly interesting the realization that migrations are hard because <strong>the team that owns the code that needs changing is not the one driving the migration.</strong> This creates a situation of misaligned incentives and makes it a socio-technical problem. The article describes the different ways the teams can collaborate to get it done, but it’s also important to understand the tools a platform team has to remove this friction in the first place, things like <a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/microservice-design-pattern-sidecar-sidekick-pattern-dbcea9bed783">sidecars</a>, <a href="https://konghq.com/learning-center/service-mesh/what-is-a-service-mesh#:~:text=Service%20mesh%20is%20a%20technology,it%20can%20be%20managed%20independently.">meshes</a> and <a href="https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2020/09/25/service-templates-service-chassis/">service chasis</a>.</p>

<p>I also included a section on how Google does Large-Scale Changes (LSC). They created a tool that allows anybody to submit Large-Scale Changes that are applied across the whole codebase. They advocate for the approach of centralizing the migration, to the point where most changes are reviewed by a single expert, and local teams hold no veto power over the LSC. They rely on code analysis and transformation tools to write the LSC and have a test infrastructure to automatically run all tests that a given change might affect in an efficient manner. To read more about their approach refer to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Google-Lessons-Programming/dp/1492082791">Software Engineering at Google</a> Chapter 14.</p>

    <updated>2022-02-14T23:02:52-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2022/02/14/pivot-tracing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pivot Tracing lets users define arbitrary metrics over trace data at runtime. It does so by combining two powerful techniques:</p>

<ol>
<li>A <strong>Happen-Before operator</strong> that allows users to perform queries based on the causal relationship of the events.</li>
<li>The ability to <strong>instrument code dinamically</strong> without having to redeploy.</li>
</ol>


<!--more-->


<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Say we have an instrumented system we want to troubleshoot:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2022-02-14/pt1.jpg" width="700"></p>

<p>The first step is to define <strong>Tracepoints</strong> ⓵. Tracepoints are pointers to the source code where the code will be instrumented to collect metrics. They are instructions on <em>where</em> and <em>how</em> to modify the system to extract the required information. You can think of them as <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html"><em>pointcuts</em> from aspect-oriented programming</a>. They can refer to any arbitrary interface or method signature or be inserted at specific line numbers.</p>

<p>Tracepoints export variables that can be used to write the queries, such as method arguments or local variables. Some default variables are provided out-of-the-box, such as: <em>host</em>, <em>timestamp</em>, <em>process id</em>, <em>process name</em>, etc.</p>

<p>The cool thing about Tracepoints is that <strong>they don’t need to be defined a priori</strong>. And since defining a Tracepoint involves no code modification, <strong>new ones can be created at no cost</strong>.</p>

<p>Tracepoints are created by someone with good system knowledge (such as developers or operators). They <strong>define the vocabulary users will use to write the queries</strong>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2022-02-14/pt2.jpg" width="700"></p>

<p>The next step is to write a query using the terms introduced by the tracepoints ⓶. A query might look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">From</span> <span class="n">incr</span> <span class="k">In</span> <span class="n">DataNodeMetrics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">incrBytesRead</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">Join</span> <span class="n">cl</span> <span class="k">In</span> <span class="k">First</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ClientProtocols</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">On</span> <span class="n">cl</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">incr</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">GroupBy</span> <span class="n">cl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">procName</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">Select</span> <span class="n">cl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">procName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">SUM</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">incr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">delta</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this example, a Tracepoint exists for the method <code>DataNodeMetrics. incrBytesRead(int delta)</code>  and another for the class <code>ClientProtocols</code>. The shown query sums the values of <code>incr.delta</code> grouped by ClientProtocol’s <code>procName</code>. The clause <code>On cl -&gt; incr</code> establishes that we’re interested in only capturing <code>cl</code> events that happened before an <code>incr</code> event. <strong>The cool thing is that these two tracepoints belong to two different services! Pivot tracing will know how to propagate the required context needed to do the join and evaluate the happens-before clause.</strong></p>

<p>Once the user submits the query, Pivot Tracing frontend compiles it to something called <strong>Advice</strong> ⓷. An Advice contains the instructions that need to be executed when a request passes through a Tracepoint to answer the query. These are the operations that can be executed as part of an Advice:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Observe:</strong> Creates a tuple from variables defined by a tracepoint.</li>
<li><strong>Filter:</strong> Evaluates a predicate on all tuples.</li>
<li><strong>Pack:</strong> Makes tuples available for use by later Advice</li>
<li><strong>Unpack:</strong> Retrieves one or more tuples from prior Advice</li>
<li><strong>Emit:</strong>Outputs a tuple for global aggregation.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Frontend creates these Advice and notifies the PT Agents to install them in the corresponding Tracepoints ⓸.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2022-02-14/pt3.jpg" width="700"></p>

<p>This is done by <em>weaving</em> generated code that gets executed every time a request passes through the Tracepoint.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2022-02-14/weaving.png" width="700"></p>

<p>For the query shown above, Advice A1 and A2 would be generated:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2022-02-14/generatedAdvices.png" width="700"></p>

<p>To do the happens-before join required by the query shown above Pivot Tracing needs to propagate the variables captured at <code>ClientProtocols Tracepoint</code> to the  <code>DataNodeMetrics Tracepoint</code>. This is done through something called <em>baggage</em> (if you’re familiar with <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage/">OTel’s baggage</a> it’s basically the same thing).  When the request gets to the <code>ClientProtocols Tracepoint</code>, the Advice A1 <em>Observes</em> the variables and <em>Packs</em> them as part of the request baggage ⓹. Later, when the code gets to the <code>DataNodeMetrics Tracepoint</code>, the Advice A2 <em>Unpacks</em> the variables, <em>Observes</em> the value of <code>delta</code>, and <em>Emits</em> a joined tuple ⓺.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2022-02-14/pt4.jpg" width="700"></p>

<p>The tuples emitted by <code>DataNodeMetrics Tracepoint</code> ⓺ are aggregated locally and then streamed to the client over the message bus ⓻.</p>

<p>Finally, Pivot Tracing Frontend uses these tuples to answer the user’s query ⓼. And that’s how the whole thing works.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2022-02-14/pt5.jpg" width="700"></p>

<h2>The power of Happens-Before</h2>

<p>One of the most remarkable features of Pivot Tracing is the Happens-Before operator: <code>-&gt;</code>. With a Happens-Before join, users can tell the system to capture events on  <em>Tracepoint B</em> only if the request first passed through <em>Tracepoint A</em>.</p>

<p>Queries that require information from multiple services participating in a request (such as the one shown above) can’t be answered through Logs or Metrics captured on single service. By the time a metric is recorded on Service A, we no longer have the context to know where that request has come from. Distributed Tracing was created to fulfill this gap, to answer the questions Logs and Metrics couldn’t answer. <strong>Yet many of today’s most popular frameworks still lack the ability to write causal queries</strong>.</p>

<p>Pivot Tracing not only supports this, but it also does it in a cost-efficient manner by only propagating just enough context to answer a given user query. This is only possible thanks to their use of Dynamic Instrumentation.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2022-02-14/happens-before.jpeg" width="500"></p>

<p>So far, we’ve used a straightforward request path for our examples: Service A -> Service B. It’s worth noting that the requests call graphs tend to be much more complex in real life. The tracepoints the user might be interested in querying could be N levels removed. The image above shows which tuples are captured by each query based on the execution graph.</p>

<h2>Pros and cons of Dynamic Instrumentation</h2>

<p>We talked about how Pivot Tracing uses AOP to dynamically instrument the code. The promise made by Dynamic Instrumentation is that developers don’t need to worry about deciding what parts of the code to instrument and which tags to record. Instead, Pivot Tracing takes care of making the required code changes to be able to answer any given query.</p>

<p>On paper, this sounds amazing. <strong>It means developers don’t need to think about observability storage costs when writing code.</strong> They don’t need to consider how traffic spikes and tag cardinality might conspire to make observability prohibitively expensive. It also removes the need to decide what parts of the code are worth measuring at design time, which is great because, by the time you’re troubleshooting an issue, you have a better idea about what kind of questions you might want to ask.</p>

<p>The cost structure makes sense too. Think about all those log lines an application spits per second and how most of the time, only one in a gazillion lines is interesting. Furthermore, Dynamic Instrumentation means the code is only instrumented as a result of a query written by the user, so any cost incurred is well justified because you can guarantee somebody is looking at the emitted data. <strong>So basically, you only pay for what you use.</strong></p>

<p>So where’s the catch?</p>

<p>We said that the Pivot Tracing only starts collecting information after the user has submitted a query. <strong>This means you only start observing the system after the issue has already occurred</strong>. If you’re lucky, it’ll happen again soon, and you’ll be able to gain some insight from the provided query. Now, <em>this is a huge if</em>. Some of the most complex bugs are those that show up every now and then and are only reproducible under rare conditions. For these bugs dynamic instrumentation might not help much. A long running query will have to be installed in place so that information can be collected the next time it happens.</p>

<p><strong>Another downside is that there’s no historical data to use as a baseline.</strong> Say users are reporting some page is slow. You can run a query and get a latency breakdown across services, but how do you know if what you’re seeing is an anomaly? Was the system this slow a week ago? Does service X always take more than 3 seconds to answer? Has the request time been affected by the deployment to service Y we made two days ago? These questions can’t be answered without stored observability data to refer to.</p>

<p>The good news is that the choice between static and dynamic instrumentation doesn’t have to be binary. In reality, you’ll want to have a mix of statically instrumented known queries (this is where your dashboard and alerts data will come from), <em>AND</em> some headroom for dynamically instrumented queries for troubleshooting. The final cost ends up being the sum of both types of instrumentation. The cost for static instrumentation is driven by storage cost, whereas the dynamic instrumentation cost is a function of emission cost which depends on the query being executed. Of course, both are directly affected by traffic volume.</p>

<p>Speaking of costs, one of the dangerous aspects of dynamic instrumentation is that the cost is directly influenced by the query provided. <strong>The paper describes no way of understanding and evaluating these costs, so they remain virtually hidden from the user writing the query</strong>. A given query could result in many kilobytes of Advice being transmitted as baggage across N services. Consider, once more, the query:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">From</span> <span class="n">incr</span> <span class="k">In</span> <span class="n">DataNodeMetrics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">incrBytesRead</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">Join</span> <span class="n">cl</span> <span class="k">In</span> <span class="k">First</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ClientProtocols</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">On</span> <span class="n">cl</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">incr</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">GroupBy</span> <span class="n">cl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">procName</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">Select</span> <span class="n">cl</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">procName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">SUM</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">incr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">delta</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a typical example of a happens-before query. The clause <code>cl -&gt; incr</code> means we only care about <code>incr</code> events if the request first passes through <code>cl</code>. A user without knowledge of how Pivot Tracing works might think that the cost of this query is proportional to the number of requests it matches, but this would be completely wrong. To answer this query, Pivot Tracing must pack <em>Advice</em> in all requests that go through <code>cl</code>. This baggage is then transmitted across <em>all</em> services downstream from <code>cl</code>. This needs to be done because the system doesn’t know a priori which of those requests will then go through <code>incr</code>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2022-02-14/instrumentation-comp.jpeg" width="700"></p>

<p>Any given query might affect the baggage content passed across <em>N</em> number of services, and there’s no way of knowing which services will be affected at query time.</p>

<p>To make things even more complicated, the capacity reserved to answer tracing queries is shared across all system users. This introduces a new set of challenges around administering said capacity. Deciding which team should have priority to run a query is not something you want to be dealing with during an incident.</p>

<p>The paper describes a series of query optimizations to keep the baggage level small. It also mentions a possible workaround to avoid packing too many tuples into the baggage, which consists of emitting all tuples instead of packing them. However, even with this workaround, some information still needs to be packed into the request context to be able to reconstruct the causality.</p>

<p>One last concern regarding dynamic instrumentation is that, by definition, <strong>a given query modifies the system being observed</strong>. If you’ve ever tried troubleshooting a bug only to discover that it doesn’t happen when the application is run on debug mode, you know how annoying this could be. In certain situations running the query might even be counter-productive. For example, consider a user troubleshooting an incident on app performance. Running a Pivot Tracing query will further add extra overhead to the system, making things even worse.</p>

<p>Despite all these pitfalls, I still believe Dynamic Instrumentation is a valuable tool and, I’d love to see it adopted in mainstream distributed tracing frameworks. The ability to write queries about any part of the code without having to manually instrument it’s just too good to pass on. We shouldn’t treat it as the primary instrumentation strategy but as a secondary method of answering complex, more specific queries crafted to troubleshoot particular incidents. Engineers designing these tools need to take extra care and put the proper safeguards in place to avoid users shooting themselves in the foot.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Extension functions are great! But if you define them all over the place, it can get confusing pretty quickly. So here’s a cool idiom to limit extension function usage to a specific context.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Last week I needed to write some code to generate <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/atlas/wiki/Stack-Language">Atlas Stack Language (ASL)</a> queries. ASL is loosely based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish Notation</a>, so you first specify the parameters and then the operation. The query I was trying to generate looked something like this:</p>

<p> <code>appName,myapp,:eq,userName,juan,:eq,:and</code></p>

<p>I already had methods for the <code>appName</code> and <code>userName</code> parts and was trying to write the method for the <code>:and</code> operator. So I started by writing the tests:</p>

<div class="kotlin-code" data-target-platform="junit" theme="darcula">
import org.junit.Assert.assertEquals
import org.junit.Assert.assertNull
import org.junit.Test

internal class ASLQueryBuilderTestV1 {

    //sampleStart

    // Tests will fail because `and` hasn't been implemented yet

    @Test
    fun `and should return correct expr if neither param is null`() {
        val expr = and("one", "two")
        assertEquals("one,two,:and", expr)
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return first param if second param is null`() {
        val expr = and("one", null)
        assertEquals("one", expr)
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return second param if receiver is null`() {
        val expr = and(null, "two")
        assertEquals("two", expr)
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return null if both params are null`() {
        val expr = and(null, null)
        assertNull(expr)
    }
    //sampleEnd
}
</div>


<p>Ok, that’s a lie 🙈 I didn’t really start with the tests, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> suggests. But let’s pretend I did for this example because the test does a good job at explaining the behavior I was going for. Note that the <code>:and</code> operator is only applied if both expressions are not <em>null</em>.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s a straightforward implementation that makes all the tests go ✅:</p>

<div class="kotlin-code" data-target-platform="junit" theme="darcula">
import org.junit.Assert.assertEquals
import org.junit.Assert.assertNull
import org.junit.Test

internal class ASLQueryBuilderTestV1 {

    @Test
    fun `and should return correct expr if neither param is null`() {
        val expr = and("one", "two")
        assertEquals("one,two,:and", expr)
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return first param if second param is null`() {
        val expr = and("one", null)
        assertEquals("one", expr)
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return second param if receiver is null`() {
        val expr = and(null, "two")
        assertEquals("two", expr)
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return null if both params are null`() {
        val expr = and(null, null)
        assertNull(expr)
    }
}

//sampleStart
fun and(expr1: String?, expr2: String?): String? {
    return when {
        expr1 != null && expr2 != null -> "$expr1,$expr2,:and"
        expr1 != null && expr2 == null -> expr1
        expr1 == null && expr2 != null -> expr2
        else -> null
    }
}
//sampleEnd
</div>


<p>My <code>and()</code> method was working, but it was not beautiful. Every time I read it, I had to do some mental gymnastics to understand what was going on 🧠🏋</p>

<p>Here, judge for yourself:</p>

<div class="kotlin-code" theme="darcula" data-highlight-only>
val expr = and(appNameEquals("myapp"), userNameEquals("juan"))
//      🤔 <- me thinking 
// expr means      (appName == myapp) AND (userName == juan)"
// expr generated  "appName,myapp,:eq,userName,juan,:eq,:and"
</div>


<p>So I had an idea, what if I write it as an <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/functions.html#infix-notation"><code>infix</code> function</a>? Infix functions can only take a single parameter, and I need to receive two expressions, so my only option was to make <code>and</code> an extension function. And that’s what I did:</p>

<div class="kotlin-code" data-target-platform="junit" theme="darcula">
import org.junit.Assert.assertEquals
import org.junit.Assert.assertNull
import org.junit.Test

internal class ASLQueryBuilderTestV1 {

    @Test
    fun `and should return correct expr if neither param is null`() {
        val expr = "one" and "two"
        assertEquals("one,two,:and", expr)
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return first param if second param is null`() {
        val expr = "one" and null
        assertEquals("one", expr)
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return second param if receiver is null`() {
        val expr = null and "two"
        assertEquals("two", expr)
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return null if both params are null`() {
        val expr = null and null
        assertNull(expr)
    }
}

//sampleStart
infix fun String?.and(other: String?): String? {
    return when {
        this != null && other != null -> "$this,$other,:and"
        this != null && other == null -> this
        this == null && other != null -> other
        else -> null
    }
}
//sampleEnd
</div>


<p>Ahh! This reads almost like English. <em>Me like it very much!</em></p>

<p>Except for one thing&hellip;</p>

<p><code>String?</code> is a pretty basic type, and <code>and()</code> is a pretty common function name. Months from now, somebody will be writing some code and IntelliJ will suggest this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-08-21/wrong-suggestion.png"></p>

<p>😱 Watch out unsuspecting coder! That <code>and</code> function doesn&rsquo;t do what you think it does!</p>

<p>Leaving this extension function around might be dangerous. So, how can we restrict callers to use it only when writing ASL queries?</p>

<h2>Extension member functions to the rescue!</h2>

<p>The trick is to create a new class named <code>AslQueryBuilder</code> and make <code>and()</code> a member function of this class. By doing so, we make sure the extension function can only be called from an instance of <code>AslQueryBuilder</code>. Nobody will confuse <code>AslQueryBuilder.and()</code> with <code>String.plus()</code>.</p>

<div class="kotlin-code" theme="darcula" data-highlight-only>
class ASLQueryBuilder {
    infix fun String?.and(other: String?): String? {
        return when {
            this != null && other != null -> "$this,$other,:and"
            this != null && other == null -> this
            this == null && other != null -> other
            else -> null
        }
    }
}
</div>


<p>IntelliJ will no longer suggest <code>and()</code> to any random <code>String?</code> unless AslQueryBuilder is in scope. Problem solved! 💪</p>

<p>We can use Kotlin&rsquo;s <code>with()</code> function to put an instance of <code>AslQueryBuilder</code> in scope to call <code>and()</code>.</p>

<div class="kotlin-code" data-target-platform="junit" theme="darcula">
import org.junit.Assert.assertEquals
import org.junit.Assert.assertNull
import org.junit.Test

internal class ASLQueryBuilderTestV3 {
    //sampleStart
    private val aslQueryBuilder = ASLQueryBuilder()

    @Test
    fun `and should return correct expr if neither param is null`() {
        val expr = with(aslQueryBuilder) { "one" and "two" }
        expectThat(expr).isEqualTo("one,two,:and")
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return first param if second param is null`() {
        val expr = with(aslQueryBuilder) { "one" and null }
        expectThat(expr).isEqualTo("one")
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return second param if receiver is null`() {
        val expr = with(aslQueryBuilder) { null and "two" }
        expectThat(expr).isEqualTo("two")
    }

    @Test
    fun `and should return null if both params are null`() {
        val expr = with(aslQueryBuilder) { null and null }
        expectThat(expr).isNull()
    }
    //sampleEnd
}

infix fun String?.and(other: String?): String? {
    return when {
        this != null && other != null -> "$this,$other,:and"
        this != null && other == null -> this
        this == null && other != null -> other
        else -> null
    }
}
</div>


<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>Now that we have an <code>ASLQueryBuilder</code> class, let&rsquo;s add the other two required methods in there too:</p>

<div class="kotlin-code" theme="darcula">
class ASLQueryBuilder {

    infix fun String?.and(other: String?): String? {
        return when {
            this != null && other != null -> "$this,$other,:and"
            this != null && other == null -> this
            this == null && other != null -> other
            else -> null
        }
    }

    fun appNameEquals(appName: String?): String? {
        return appName?.let { ":appName,$it,eq" }
    }

    fun userNameEquals(userName: String?): String? {
        return userName?.let { ":userName,$it,eq" }
    }
}

fun main() {
    val aslQueryBuilder = ASLQueryBuilder()
    val finalExpression = with(aslQueryBuilder) {
        appNameEquals("myApp") and userNameEquals("juan")
    }
    print(finalExpression) // :appName,myApp,eq,:userName,juan,eq,:and
}
</div>


<p>And that’s it! The query generation code reads nicely and is easy to understand, and <strong>developers can&rsquo;t call the functions without the explicit <code>ASLQueryBuilder</code> context instance, so nobody will use them accidentally</strong>. With this technique we can add any extensions we want to common types without worrying it might pollute the auto-complete and be misused.</p>

    <updated>2021-07-28T08:39:37-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2021/07/28/sifter-scalable-sampling-for-distributed-traces</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Distributed tracing can be ridiculously expensive if you try to trace a hundred percent of requests. A common technique to reduce costs is to sample only a small portion of the traffic. But naive sampling techniques like <em>uniform sampling</em> will inevitably capture more common-case executions and might miss the more interesting edge cases. Instead, <strong><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3357223.3362736">Sifter’s approach</a> is to bias sampling decisions towards outliers and anomalous traces.</strong> This way, anomalous traces have a higher chance of being sampled, and the more uninteresting traces are discarded.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Sifter uses the incoming stream of traces to <strong>builds a model that approximates the system’s common-case behavior</strong>. To make a sampling decision, it checks how well the model matches the incoming trace. Sampling is biased toward traces that are <em>not</em> well approximated (outliers and anomalous traces).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-07-28/full-pipeline.png"></p>

<h3>The model</h3>

<p>Sifter uses a 2-layer neural network that models the probability of an event occurring given its immediate predecessors and successors. To create this model, they first extract all <em>N</em>-length paths for each trace.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-07-28/paths.png"></p>

<p>For a given path (p_0<em>, …, p_N</em>), the neural network predicts the probability of p_N/2_ given its surrounding events p_0<em>, … , p_N</em> (excluding  p_N/2_). The model gives better predictions for paths that are seeing more frequently in the input dataset.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-07-28/neural-network.png"></p>

<h3>Sampling</h3>

<p>To make a sampling decision, Sifter first extracts all <em>N</em>-length paths from traces and feeds that into the model. It then uses the output to calculate the prediction&rsquo;s <em>loss</em>, that is the difference between the predicted and actual events. <strong>The higher the loss, the more “interesting” the trace is.</strong></p>

<p>The <em>loss</em> is then weighted against the loss of the <em>k</em> most recent traces.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-07-28/formula-loss.png"></p>

<p>If all traces have the same <em>loss</em>, then the trace is sampled uniformly at random with probability <em>α</em>. Otherwise, the probability is calculated using this formula:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-07-28/formula-sampling.png"></p>

<p>Traces with the lowest <em>loss</em> will have a sampling probability of zero. Traces with the highest loss will have the highest sampling probability.</p>

<h3>Updating the model</h3>

<p>Sifter does a gradient descent back-propagation pass on the model for every trace seen to keep the model up-to-date. It also adds the trace’s loss into the window of <em>k</em> most recent traces and pops the oldest value. Note that <strong>this happens on every trace regardless of whether it is sampled or not.</strong></p>

<h2>Sifter’s Properties</h2>

<p>The following list is a summary of Sifter’s design choices and their consequences:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sifter’s operates online over a continuous stream of traces.</strong>  The overhead added by sampling is in the order of milliseconds. This latency is affected only by the trace size and the number of unique events in a trace. It is independent of the workload volume and the number of previously sampled traces.</li>
<li><strong>Sifter is not feature-based.</strong> The model used to identify interesting traces does not require any feature engineering from developers. As a consequence, Sifter’s approach is not limited to what developers consider interesting a priori. Instead, interesting features on the sampled traces can be discovered rather than engineered.</li>
<li>As a corollary to the previous point, <strong>Sifter can automatically adapt to changes in traffic over time.</strong> The model is updated with every incoming trace, and the sampling probability is adjusted as the workload distribution changes.</li>
<li>The amount of memory needed to keep Sifter’s model is a function of <em>N</em> the path size, <em>E</em> the label vocabulary, and <em>k</em> the number of most recently seen traces we consider. The total size is constant with respect to the workload volume and the number of sampling traces.</li>
<li><strong>Sifter does not require any pre-training or manual configuration before operation.</strong> On bootstrap, it’ll start making random sampling decisions while learning the model’s system behavior with every new trace.</li>
<li>Sifter’s model converts traces into a <em>directed acyclic graph</em> of labels based on event origin, i.e. source file and line number. It does not consider other span features like timing, tags, annotations, etc.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2021/03/07/google-docs-could-be-so-much-better/"/>
    <updated>2021-03-07T18:50:06-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2021/03/07/google-docs-could-be-so-much-better</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lots of businesses run on Google Docs. It&rsquo;s how we write memos, define strategies, discuss proposals, document decisions, write tutorials, and plenty of other things.</p>

<p>Google Docs is a fantastic piece of technology. I almost can&rsquo;t imagine how we worked before it (<em>productStrategy-Jun-2004-version13.docx</em> anyone?). And yet, I sometimes feel like it could be so much more! Like we&rsquo;ll look back in 10 years and think: <em>“My god! I can’t believe we were working that way!”</em>. Improving Docs has the potential of completely overhauling the way information flows through an organization. Here are some ideas on how Google could improve it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Smart Summaries</h2>

<p>It’s early in the morning, and you’re checking your emails. You notice your boss shared the new strategy memo. You still have 15’ minutes to your next meeting, so you think: <em>“I’ll catch up on this one real quick”</em>. You start reading and, in the first paragraph, you found a reference to another doc you were not aware of. So you open the link on a new tab and keep going. As you tread through the doc, you find more and more links to review. Before you know your browser looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-03-29/tabs.png" width="700"></p>

<p>What you thought would take five minutes ends up being an endeavor that takes you the whole morning.</p>

<p>There’s probably no good way around this problem if you need to absorb every detail. But more often than not, all you need is a high level overview of the referenced content. The further away you move from your starting doc, the less detail you probably want.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if Docs could automagically generate that summary by using a bit of AI? We could read the auto-generated summary and decide if we need to go deeper down the rabbit hole. The experience would be similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAeloLXO8T0">Link Preview feature</a> released in 2020.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-03-29/link-preview.gif"></p>

<h2>Discovery and Navigation</h2>

<p>Google Docs favors a filesystem-like organization. You can sort your docs into folders and browse them in a tree view, just like you would navigate files on your local machine.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-03-29/folders.png" width="200"></p>

<p>It’s a well-known pattern that we are all familiar with, and it works great when there’s a centralized authority dictating how things are supposed to be organized. But that’s not how knowledge works. Our brain likes to connect thoughts and ideas in the most unintuitive ways, making connections that at first would look random. Some note-taking apps recognized this need and built experiences around the concept of navigating documents based on how they relate to each other. If the idea sounds strange, just think about how web pages work by links that point to other pages. Imagine if we could capture this relationship <strong>on both ends, and list all outgoing and incoming connections</strong>. This is exactly how <a href="https://collectednotes.com/blog/zettelkasten">Collected Notes</a> works.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-03-29/collected-notes.jpeg" width="650"></p>

<p>This paradigm lets us navigate the relationship in both directions! Let’s say we wrote a thoughtful memo on <a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2020/05/09/the-whiteboard-interview-is-broken/">”why we should stop asking people to invert a binary tree as part of the interview process”</a>. People seemed to like it and start sharing it around. Soon it gains traction, and everybody in the company is talking about it. With bi-directional links, we’d be able to see how our ideas are referenced on other documents. We can keep an eye on any proposals (or refutals) that are inspired by the original post.</p>

<p>From these links, we could create new visualizations to represent how documents relate to each other. This can help us identify the most popular docs at a glance and discover patterns like high-level strategy docs linked by more specific implementation docs. <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> has a view called <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/graph">“Graph Overview”</a> to serve this purpose. Each dot represents a note, and each line is a reference. The bigger the dot, the more connections it has.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-03-29/roam.png" width="500"></p>

<h2>Consuming content</h2>

<p>We all know Google Docs is an <em>amazing</em> tool for producing content. For consuming it? Not so much 😒👎🏼 Yet the time we spend reading documents is far greater than the time we spend writing them. Improving the reading experience would make everybody a more effective collaborator.</p>

<blockquote><p>Learning is more effective when it is an active rather than a passive process.</p><footer><strong>Kurt Lewin</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>To comprehend something more easily, we need to work with the content. We need to highlight important parts, scratch things out, scribble notes and comments on the margins, etc. In other words, we need to pour our ideas on the doc and make it our own. My favorite app to do this kind of interactive reading is <a href="https://www.liquidtext.net/">LiquidText</a>, it works especially well on an iPad with the Apple Pencil.  I use it to read docs, articles, papers, and sometimes even books.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-03-29/liquid-text.jpeg" width="700"></p>

<p>Imagine if we could get a similar experience <em>within</em> Google Docs. What if we could have a private view of the doc where we’d be able to mark it and comment it to our heart’s content. Of course, you can get halfway there today by copying the doc before reading it, but that’d totally break the collaborative features since the copy will never get the updates/comments the original will receive.</p>

<p>The fact that these notes would be private doesn’t mean that we can’t mine them for insight. It’d be pretty easy to leverage the private highlights to power the AI summary mentioned above, or to provide an auto-highlighting feature alla Kindle.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-03-29/highlight.jpeg" width="500"></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Common knowledge says that you don’t deploy on Friday if you want to have a peaceful weekend. Yet, some people will tell you that if you’re not comfortable deploying every day of the week, you’re doing it wrong. They’ll say that deploying shouldn’t be scary and that you probably don’t have enough tests. So, which one is it?</p>

<!--more-->


<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-01-22/homer-deploying.png" width="350"></p>

<h2>The problem with Fridays</h2>

<p>Fridays are the last day of the working week, and for many teams, it might also be the end of the sprint/cycle/iteration. Explicit or not, there’s a deadline looming between the developer and the weekend. We invested long hours on this new feature, and we just want to push it out the door, close the ticket, and come back to a clean slate on Monday. Nobody likes heading into the weekend feeling like a fraud because they couldn’t complete the planned tasks in time. The bigger the task, the more eager we are to close it.</p>

<p>So what do we do? We rush it. Maybe we skip testing in a staging environment or turn a blind eye to that flaky test that always fails, and <em>we ship it</em>. We feel the weight being lifted off our shoulders as we click deploy, and we head out the door smiling, ready to enjoy the weekend.</p>

<p>Only somebody will have to clean up our mess when things go south.</p>

<h2>When is a task completed?</h2>

<p>To understand how to combat the danger of Fridays, let’s consider the <em>software lifecycle</em>. That is, the things that happen between <em>“I have to implement feature X”</em> and  <em>“<em>people using it in production</em>”</em>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-01-22/software-lifecycle1.jpeg" width="700"></p>

<p>From the developer&rsquo;s point of view, when would you say that feature X is <em>Done</em>? Is it once the branch is merged? Is it after the code is deployed? The answer depends on what your team considers the developer’s responsibility. On teams doing <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249">Full Cycle Development</a>, the same person writing the code is the one that will test, operate and deploy the service. Which means that <strong>the feature can only be marked as Done once it’s being used in production.</strong></p>

<p>Deploying is only one step, after which you <strong>release</strong> the change to some (or all) of your users and <strong>observe</strong> that it is working as intended. <em><em>Spoiler Alert</em></em> Sometimes it won’t be, and you’ll have to go back to the code and add little fixes here and there.</p>

<p>Treating deployments as just another phase of the software lifecycle enables <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/observability-driven-development/">Observability Driven Development</a>. Letting developers <em>see</em> how their code behaves in production before closing the task.</p>

<h2>Optimizing the feedback loops</h2>

<p>The software lifecycle diagram shown above is an over-simplification. In reality, the flow is never a straight line. Every step can send you back to a previous step: Started coding and found a flaw in the design, go back to design  🔙, a test started failing, go back to develop 🔙, etc.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-01-22/software-lifecycle2.jpeg" width="700"></p>

<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html">The secret sauce to a highly efficient team is keeping these feedback loops as short as possible</a>. If your tests take thirty minutes to run, by the time you see the failure, you’re already deep in some other task (or worse, on your 9th YouTube video).</p>

<p>Deploying is no different. If it takes months for your code to reach production, by the time your users start using your new feature (and uncovering bugs), you have already moved on to something else. You no longer have the context fresh on your mind, and you barely recall the details and the design decisions taken at the time (which is why <a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2020/12/26/documenting-decisions/">you should be documenting those decisions</a>).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-01-22/software-lifecycle3.jpeg" width="700"></p>

<h2>How to make deployments less scary</h2>

<p><strong>The single most important change you can make to have less scary deployments, is to deploy small changes. Ideally, deploying one change at a time. One Pull Request ➡️ one Deploy.</strong> This will inevitably lead to more deployments because now you might have to do ten deployments to match your big dump releases of the past. This is good! The more you deploy, the less scary it is.</p>

<p>Deploying small changes also gives you better visibility into how your code is affecting the service. <strong>By releasing one change at a time, developers can use telemetry to observe how the code behaves in production and spot bugs before your users do</strong>. In contrast, if you batch multiple PRs in a single deploy, you might have a harder time figuring out which of the changes caused the issue. You might even have to convince the developer that what caused the issue is indeed their commit and not somebody else’s bundled together in the same release. You can avoid all this hassle by following the “one PR ➡️ one Deploy” rule.</p>

<p>And the benefits don’t end there! Smaller changes also mean shorter code reviews. It’s easier for developers reviewing your code to spot bugs in a small PR than in a huge one that modifies hundreds of lines. This is another way in which smaller changes bring better code quality.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2021-01-22/huge-pr.jpeg" width="400"></p>

<p>Last but not least, smaller PRs produce short-lived branches, reducing the number of merge conflicts one has to deal with.</p>

<h2>Deploying != Releasing</h2>

<p>For this approach to work, you need to trust devs with the keys to production. Depending on how your team operates, this might sound risky. <em>Are you saying developers can put code in production whenever they want?</em> Yes! That’s exactly what we’re advocating for. As pointed out earlier, this will mean more deploys, but it’s generally safer than the humongous release approach. Even if it feels like you lose control of what goes out the door. Yes, you’ll be deploying bugs from time to time, but the blast radius is limited, and the change is easier to rollback.</p>

<p><strong>Now, this doesn’t mean that all users are immediately able to see the new changes as soon as you deploy.</strong> The terms <em>deploy</em> and <em>release</em> are sometimes used interchangeably, so let’s define how we’ll use them here:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Deploy:</strong> Put a new version of the code in production.</li>
<li><strong>Release:</strong> Make some functionality available to users.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can (and should) still control at what rate new functionality is released to users. You might use a rollout strategy where only a subset of power-users get to see what you’re working on and provide feedback before the feature is released to a broader audience. Or, you might want to start by observing how it works on a small percentage of users and then gradually roll out to everyone else. You can achieve this by hiding the new code behind <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">Feature Flags</a> and have it conditionally enabled. This provides the extra benefit of being able to enable and disable the code with a simple configuration change (without requiring a deploy), should a critical bug be found.</p>

<h2>It’s not about testing</h2>

<p>One common argument from the <em>“deploy on Fridays”</em> camp is about testing. It goes like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you’re scared of deploying on a Friday, it means you either don’t have enough tests or your tests are not good enough.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don’t buy it.</p>

<p>No matter how many tests you have, how good your coverage is, you can’t be sure you’re not releasing a bug. In the words of Dijkstra: <em> Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence.</em></p>

<p>Most automated tests are about validating the scenarios the dev can come up with during development. They don’t account for things we can’t predict<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. So most testing is limited by the imagination of the person writing the test.</p>

<p>Furthermore, our tests usually run in a fake environment where many of the components are mocked. From service stubs to in-memory databases, we use every trick in the book to <a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2020/07/27/effective-testing-reducing-non-determinism/">reduce non-determinism from our tests</a>, but this comes at the cost of test fidelity. Our tests no longer accurately represent what happens in production. This is why we need observability and <a href="https://copyconstruct.medium.com/testing-in-production-the-safe-way-18ca102d0ef1">testing in production</a>. This is why we need to <em>deploy</em> and <em>observe</em> to ensure our code is working as intended.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To sum up, deploying is just an additional step of the software lifecycle. <strong>You should deploy any day of the week, providing you’re willing to stick around to observe how your code behaves in production. </strong> If you just want to deploy, and run home to start the weekend, then maybe <em>don’t</em>. Because no matter how many tests you have, you haven’t seen your code running in a real environment yet. In the future, we might have DevOps AI to observe and rollback our changes automatically if something looks weird. Until then, though, you’re on the hook for making sure your code is working as intended. <em>Especially on Fridays.</em></p>

<p>Piecemeal deployments will help you release faster and will improve your code quality. The idea is counter-intuitive, but it works: you have to do the scary thing over and over until it becomes an uninteresting event. Releasing frequently will help you catch bugs sooner and will make your team more efficient.</p>

    <updated>2020-12-26T13:51:06-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/12/26/documenting-decisions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s Monday morning. You’re sitting at your desk with your steaming cup of Joe, ready to sink your teeth into that new feature you have to develop. The <code>git pull</code> downloads months worth of changes, and you dive into the code. Piece by piece, you start building a mental model of the system, trying to make sense of the different components. But something doesn’t feel right. Why was it built this way? It feels weird, it feels so obviously wrong, so poorly designed, so suboptimal.</p>

<p>You realize you need help. Whoever wrote this mess should be able to provide some context. You run <code>git blame</code> and your own name hits you in the face like a brick. You start thinking that maybe it’s no so wrong. That you probably had your reasons. If you could only go back in time and ask your past self…</p>

<h2>Architecture Decision Logs</h2>

<p>Good developers write code that is easy to understand and use comments to provide additional context. Great teams write documentation explaining how the system is designed and how it is supposed to work. But even if you are blessed with both, there’s still a piece that is usually missing. <strong>Something that can answer the question: <em>How did we end up here?</em>.</strong> Something that can provide context on why the system was designed this way, on what other options were considered and rejected, on why we picked this particular technology or pattern.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what an <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record">Architecture Decision Log (ADR)</a> is for.</p>

<blockquote><p>An <strong>Architecture Decision Record (ADR)</strong> is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.</p>

<p>An <strong>Architecture Decision Log (ADL)</strong> is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization).</p></blockquote>

<p>An Architecture Decision Log can help us capture the context, motivations, and assumptions behind a decision. We are basically doing a brain dump of all the things that were considered before making a final call on something.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-12-26/architecture.gif" width="500"></p>

<p>If one thing is constant about developing software is change. New features are requested, the app grows and it has to support an increasing number of requests, people leave the team and new developers join. By keeping an Architecture Decision Log, we capture the thought process that goes into a decision, <strong>so that future maintainers can understand why something is the way it is, and use this information to evaluate new changes.</strong>  Maybe an assumption made about how users would use the app turned out not to be true. Or perhaps a requirement about the size of stored data has changed, and the existing database can’t scale accordingly.</p>

<p>And that’s not all! ADLs can also provide information about the path not taken. We can document what other alternatives were considered and why they didn’t fly. If some possible solution was initially considered, chances are it’ll come up again as a suggestion in the future. By documenting the research, we avoid new team members wasting their time going down the same rabbit holes explored in the past. Or at least we provide a starting point for a potential re-evaluation.</p>

<h2>The Template</h2>

<p>There are a bunch of templates you can follow in this <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record#adr-example-templates">GitHub repo</a>. But to be honest, the template doesn’t really matter as much as actually writing them. I usually go with something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Information:</strong> This is like a header where you can include the date, the topic, and who’s writing. Most of this metadata can be obtained from the history if you’re versioning your documentation (as you should), but I think it’s worth repeating it at the start of the document for clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Problem Context:</strong> A brief description of what you’re trying to solve and why. <em>Don’t forget the why</em>, it might be obvious to you at the time of writing, but it won’t be to someone else in a couple of months/years.</li>
<li><strong>Details:</strong> This is usually the longest part. Here you can describe all the alternative solutions explored and detail the pros and cons of each approach.</li>
<li><strong>What was decided:</strong> In this section, you document the final decision as well as the rationale on why one option was picked over the others. Usually, you’ll be making some guess or assumption about how the system will evolve in the future, make sure to include those too.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you’re curious about what they look like, you can see some ADR examples <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/tree/master/examples">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>

<p>You can start your Architecture Decision Log as a new section of your documentation. <strong>I favor keeping documentation as close to the code as possible. Ideally, in the same repository.</strong> Why? Because it’s easier to keep them in sync that way. For example, you can submit your code and documentation changes as part of the same PR. It also makes it more discoverable, as searching for a term in the IDE will bring up results on both code and documentation.</p>

<p>Whatever tool you use, make sure your documentation is searchable and, above all, easy to edit. Ideally, it should also be versioned. I think <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a> fits the bill pretty well, and it’s easy to setup.</p>

<h2>How to write a good ADRs</h2>

<p>Some advice on how to write a good Architecture Decision Record:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Write everything down, even if it’s obvious.</strong> The document you are writing might need to be read by somebody new to the team years from now. Try to paint a complete picture.</li>
<li><strong>It’s not just about the technical stuff.</strong> Many factors that contribute to a design decision. It might be the team size, the team knowledge of a specific technology or some deadline that needs to be met.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it honest.</strong> Engineering is about cutting corners. There’s no shame in taking shortcuts, so don’t try to hide it. If some decision was taken because of time constraints or the team resorted to a technology only because it’s what they know best, then better to be upfront about it.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it short or include a TL;DR.</strong> Keep it easily digestible. If you are including all of the research done, you might want to consider adding it as an appendix. If the document is too long, make sure there’s a good summary on the top so that somebody not interested in the details can still get an overview of the decision.</li>
<li><strong>ADRs are immutable.</strong> You’re capturing a snapshot of a decision, so there’s no need to update ADRs after time has passed. If new things come up, you can always create a new document and link it to the previous one.</li>
<li><strong>You can write ADRs even if you don’t have code.</strong> I had tasks that ended up being just an ADR. Maybe you start exploring some performance improvement only to realize it is not feasible. Instead of just scrapping all the code, make sure to include an ADR detailing what the idea was, and why it didn’t succeed. That way, the next time somebody suggests it, they can learn from your attempt instead of falling into the same pitfalls.</li>
<li><strong>Make it fun.</strong> Just because it’s documentation doesn’t mean it has to be boring. Tell a story. Make it fun! include pictures, diagrams, memes. Use emojis! 😄</li>
</ol>


<h2>The future (hopefully)</h2>

<p>I believe there’s plenty of room for improvement and innovation in the area of documentation tooling. <strong>One thing I’d love to see are smart ADRs that would trigger a notification when one of the assumptions documented breaks.</strong> For example, let’s say your team chose to keep some information in memory for every request because the payload size is expected to be small. They made the call, implemented the code and wrote the appropriate ADR. It’d be great if they could also include a metric as part of the documentation that would monitor that the assumption holds. That way, the team would get notified if, at some point, the expectation is no longer valid. The alert would link to the ADR including context about what system decisions are affected by this violation, and what other facts need to be considered if a change is required.</p>

    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/09/07/effective-testing-show-whats-important-hide-the-rest</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What we include in a test is as important as what we leave out. Having the right amount of information helps us understand what the test is doing at a glance.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Let&rsquo;s say we need to check our Restaurants are behaving correctly. We want to validate two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>That a restaurants can only cook a <code>Recipe</code> if they have all the necessary ingredients.</li>
<li>That vegan restaurants do not serve non-vegan food</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-09-07/restaurantTestsBefore.png" width="700" title="‘Repetitive tests’" ></p>

<p>This works fine, but writing a new <code>Recipe</code> for every single test gets repetitive pretty fast. More importantly, most lines of the test are spent creating the <code>Recipe</code> object. By having to spell out every single property, we lose track of what’s important for each specific test.</p>

<p>Luckily, we can use <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html#default-arguments">Kotlin default arguments</a> to make the tests better. We could introduce default values directly on the <code>Recipe</code> class, but that would mean we’d have to pick sensible defaults for Recipes in production. We probably don’t want to allow for this flexibility, as we want to force users to specify those properties for each recipe defined. Instead, we will write a <a href="https://phauer.com/2018/best-practices-unit-testing-kotlin/#use-helper-functions-with-default-arguments-to-ease-object-creation"><em>helper function</em></a> with default arguments to handle the <code>Recipe</code> creation. We’ll make it <code>private</code> so that it’s only accessible in the test class.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-09-07/helperFunction.png" width="700" title="‘Helper function’" ></p>

<p>Now we can re-write our tests to make use of the helper function:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-09-07/restaurantTestsAfter.png" width="700" title="‘Improved tests’" ></p>

<p>On each test, we only specify the property that the test cares about and leave out all the other ones. This way, somebody glancing at the test can immediately identify what we’re checking, and it’s not distracted by the details on how to create a <code>Recipe</code> object.</p>

<p>Note that this is a simplified example. In real life, the object being created could have multiple nested objects and require many steps to be initialized. All that code would be hidden in our helper function instead of bloating every test.</p>

<p>We could have written the test for vegan recipes without specifying any property, and it would still pass.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-09-07/notExplicit.png" width="700" title="‘Not explicit enough tests’" ></p>

<p>By default <code>isVegan</code> is true, so we&rsquo;re not required to define it. However, <strong>we opted for explicitly specifying it in the test</strong>, just so that somebody reading the test would know that the value of <code>isVegan</code>  is important for this test. As an extra benefit, the test will not break if, in the future, somebody decides to change the default value for <code>isVegan</code>.</p>

    <link href="http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/07/27/effective-testing-reducing-non-determinism/"/>
    <updated>2020-07-27T22:00:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/07/27/effective-testing-reducing-non-determinism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Flaky tests are those that randomly fail for no apparent reason. If you have a flaky test, you might re-run it, over and over, until it succeeds. If you have a <em>couple</em> of them, the chances of all passing at the same time are slim, so maybe you ignore the failures. You know, just this one time… Soon enough, you’re not paying attention to failures on this test suite. Congratulations! Your tests are now worthless.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Prefer smaller tests</h2>

<p>Non-determinism is often introduced as a consequence of relying on external services. For example, let’s say our test needs to read data from a database, the test might fail if the database is down, or the data is not present, or has changed.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html">Test Pyramid</a> before. Tests are classified by scope, and the recommendation is to favor tests with reduced scopes (i.e. Unit Tests).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-31/TestingPyramid.jpg" width="700" title="‘Using data classes for assertions’" ></p>

<p>At Google they came up with a new dimension: <em>Test Size</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Tests are grouped in categories <strong>based on the resources a test needs to run</strong> (memory, processes, time, etc.).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>X-Small</strong> tests are limited to a single thread or coroutine. They are not allowed to sleep, do I/O operations, or make network calls.</li>
<li><strong>Small</strong> tests run on a single process. All other X-Small restrictions still apply.</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> tests are confined to a single machine. Can’t make network calls to anywhere other than <code>localhost</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Large</strong> tests can span multiple machines. They&rsquo;re allowed to do everything.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Scope</em> and <em>Size</em> are related, but independent. You could have an end-to-end test of a CLI tool that runs in a single process.</p>

<p>How does this tie back to our crusade against flaky tests? Simple, <strong>the smaller the test, the more deterministic it’ll be.</strong> As a bonus perk, they also tend to be faster.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-31/TestSizes.jpg" width="700" title="‘Test sizes’" ></p>

<p>Google went the extra mile and built infrastructure to enforce these constraints. For example, a test marked as <em>Small</em> would fail if it tried to do I/O.</p>

<h2>How to make your test small</h2>

<p>Some ways you can reduce the size of your test:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html">Test Doubles</a> to avoid making calls to external services.</li>
<li>Use an <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-h2-database">in-memory Database</a>.</li>
<li>Use an <a href="https://github.com/google/jimfs">in-memory filesystem</a>.</li>
<li>Design your classes so that <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained#testing-timed-eviction">test can provide a custom time source</a> instead of relying on the system clock.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/tree/master/kotlinx-coroutines-test">kotlinx-coroutines-test</a> to virtually advance time without having to make your test wait.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">Testcontainers</a> to turn a <em>Large</em> test into a <em>Medium</em> one.</li>
</ol>


<h2>The trade-off</h2>

<p>The downside of artificially isolating your tests is that they lose <em>Fidelity</em>. Meaning, what you end up testing is further away from what will run in production. <a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2018/06/23/oracle-jpa-and-the-mistery-of-the-string-that-was-null/">I’ve been bitten by this in the past</a>.</p>

<p>The trick is to have a test distribution similar to the one proposed by the Test Pyramid. We should have lots of <em>Small</em> and <em>X-Small</em> tests, some <em>Medium</em> tests, and only a few <em>Large</em> tests.</p>

    <link href="http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/07/18/effective-testing-expressive-assertions/"/>
    <updated>2020-07-18T11:58:34-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/07/18/effective-testing-expressive-assertions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Using expressive assertions can help us figure out why a test fails without having to go through the code.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an example. Here&rsquo;s a test making sure our recipe has tomatoes 🍅</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/badAssertion.png" width="700" title="‘A test with a non-descriptive assertion’" ></p>

<p>At first glance, everything looks ok. The test passes, it is easy to read, and it follows <a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2020/07/10/effective-testing-test-structure/">the <em>”Given - When - Then”</em>  structure</a>.</p>

<p>Some months go by, and one day our test starts failing.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/badAssertionOutput.png" width="700" title="‘The output of a test with a non-descriptive assertion’" ></p>

<p>At this point, we&rsquo;ve probably forgotten everything about the recipe, and we’re not sure what’s causing the failure. <a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2020/07/05/effective-testing-use-descriptive-test-names/">The test name is not helping us much either</a>.</p>

<p>To avoid this situation, we can include a message that will be displayed whenever the assertion fails.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/withMessage.png" width="700" title="‘Assertion with explicit message’" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/withMessageOutput.png" width="700" title="‘Output of a test with an assertion with explicit message’" ></p>

<p>Now the failure is obvious. There is no 🍅 on the recipe. <strong>We can immediately tell what’s wrong without even looking at the test code.</strong> But we can do better…</p>

<h2>Assertion libraries</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, writing this kind of detailed message for every assertion would be a pain in the ass. Fortunately, we don’t have to. Instead, <strong>we can use an <a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/comparison-assertion-libraries/">expressive assertion library</a> to do the heavy lifting for us.</strong> This is how our code would look like using <a href="https://strikt.io/">Strikt</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/strikt.png" width="700" title="‘Example using Strikt’" ></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re using <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html#infix-notation">Kotlin infix notation</a> to make the code more readable. This a stylistic decision, you don’t have to use it if you don’t like it.</p>

<p>You might notice we&rsquo;re calling the <code>contains</code> method on the assertion itself. This is possible because Strikt can tell that the type we’re asserting on, is a <em>String</em>, and thus, it can provide methods explicitly tailored to Strings. This is what the error message would look like in this case:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/outputStrikt.png" width="700" title="‘Output of the basic Strikt example’" ></p>

<p><strong>Almost the same information we got from writing our own message, but without the boilerplate.</strong></p>

<p>Assertion libraries are like swiss army knives; they provide all kinds of assertions for different types of objects. I suggest learning a few of the core ones through the documentation, and then letting the IDE guide you with auto-suggestions to discover new ones.</p>

<p>Here are some more examples of type-specific assertions:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/collectionAssertion.png" width="700" title="‘Collection specific assertions’" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/assertingExceptions.png" width="700" title="‘Asserting exceptions’" ></p>

<h2>Asserting on objects</h2>

<p>When validating properties on objects, you might be tempted to write something like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/badObjectAssertions.png" width="700" title="‘Manually asserting properties on object’" ></p>

<p>You can probably tell why this is bad. By the time we see the failure, we no longer have context on what property we’re asserting.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/objectAssertionOutput.png" width="700" title="‘Using data classes for assertions’" ></p>

<p>Was it checking the <code>title</code>, the <code>author</code>, or something else?</p>

<p>Instead, you can take advantage of the fact that Data Classes automatically get <code>equals</code> and <code>toString</code> implementations. So we can use an <code>assertEquals</code> and get a nice looking message showing us both instances.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/dataClasses.png" width="700" title="‘Using data classes for assertions’" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/dataClassesOutput.png" width="700" title="‘Using data classes test output’" ></p>

<p>If we don&rsquo;t care about comparing all properties we can use <a href="https://strikt.io/wiki/traversing-subjects/">Strikt to assert only specific fields</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/traversingObjects.png" width="700" title="‘Using Strikt to traverse objects on assertions’" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-19/traversingObjectsOutput.png" width="700" title="‘Strikt object traversal test output’" ></p>

<p>The <a href="https://strikt.io/wiki/assertion-styles/">block assertion style</a> means that even though the <em>title</em> assertion failed Strikt will still check for <em>page count</em> and <strong>it’ll provide output for all the assertions in the block.</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One way to make sure your tests are readable is to have them all adhere to the same structure.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>By far, the most common structure is <strong>&ldquo;Given - When - Then”</strong> (aka <em>“Arrange, Act, Assert”</em>). It goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>On Given</strong>: We create the objects and set up the needed state.</li>
<li><strong>On When</strong>: We perform the action we want to test.</li>
<li><strong>On Then</strong>: We validate the state changed as expected.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example:</p>

<p>The comments explaining each section are optional, and can be omitted on trivial scenarios like the one shown here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Picking good test names can help us identify what&rsquo;s wrong with our code when something fails.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It&rsquo;s Friday afternoon. You finally finished that long refactor you’ve been working on for the whole week. Everything is looking good. Except you run the tests and see one failure.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-05/BadNames.png" title="‘Test output with bad test names’" ></p>

<p style='text-align: center; font-size: 42px;'>
🤔
</p>


<p>Unfortunately, <strong>you can&rsquo;t really tell what&rsquo;s broken from looking at that output</strong>. You’ll have to browse the test code to identify the failure.</p>

<p>But what if the output looked more like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-05/GoodNames.png" title="‘Test output with good test names’" ></p>

<p>Now the issue is obvious. <strong>You can immediately tell which part of the code is not working and what the output should be.</strong></p>

<p>Test names are the first (and often only) piece of information we see about a test. Using a descriptive test name can help us identify what’s broken at a glance. Furthermore, it helps us keep the test focused on validating one specific behavior, discouraging us from inflating the test with other unrelated assertions.</p>

<h2>How</h2>

<p>Instead of just using the name of the method being tested, try focusing on the behavior you want to validate. <strong>Describe the state of the system, the action performed, and the expected output.</strong> More often than not, you’ll end up with a huge name, something you probably wouldn’t use on production code, but that’s ok.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using Kotlin, you can <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html#function-names">use backticks to have whitespaces in your function name</a>. If you’re working with <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/">JUnit</a> you can leverage the <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.3/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/DisplayName.html"><code>@DisplayName</code></a> annotation for prettier names. You can even get emojis in there:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-05/WithEmojis.png" title="‘Test output with emojis’" ></p>

<p>You can also write a custom name generator using <code>@DisplayNameGeneration</code> <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/junit-custom-display-name-generator">as shown here</a>.</p>

<p>Some testing libraries like <a href="https://github.com/kotest/kotest/">Kotest</a>, also <a href="https://github.com/kotest/kotest/blob/master/doc/styles.md#should-spec">support nesting tests</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-07-05/NestedNames.png" title="‘Test output with emojis’" ></p>

<p>You can read more about test naming in Chapter 12 of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Google-Lessons-Programming/dp/1492082791/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=software+engineering+at+google&amp;link_code=qs&amp;qid=1594020903&amp;sr=8-2&amp;tag=wwwcanoniccom-20">Software Engineering at Google</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/05/30/working-with-queues/"/>
    <updated>2020-05-30T19:29:39-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/05/30/working-with-queues</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Queues are a powerful tool for building reliable systems. In this article, I’ll describe some of the tips and tricks I came across when working with queues.</p>

<p>Some of the advice is specific to Amazon SQS queues because that’s what I’ve been using the most lately. And also because some of them come from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/avoiding-insurmountable-queue-backlogs/">this amazing article</a> from the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/">Amazon Builders’ Library</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The trade-off</h2>

<p>Queues can be used to increase the system’s availability by accepting new messages even if our service is down. They help us decouple producers from consumers. When using systems like SQS, we also get a durability guarantee, because we know messages published won’t be lost if our system fails as they are persisted in the queue. Additionally, we get an increase in reliability since we can configure our system to retry the processing of a message in case of failure.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-06-07/Availability.png" title="‘Example of how queues can increase availability’" ></p>

<p>These advantages come at a cost. <strong>We get better reliability, availability, and durability at the price of increased latency</strong>. Meaning, messages can take longer to be processed compared to a synchronous system. This is because our system might have to go through a backlog of old messages before getting to the one just published. Furthermore, if the pace at which messages are put on the queue is faster than the speed at which our system can process them, the system might never be able to catch up!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-06-07/Overflow.gif" title="‘Animation on how a slow consuming queue can overflow’" ></p>

<p>Let’s go over some of the things we can do to prevent or mitigate these risks.</p>

<h3>1. Wrapping your queues</h3>

<p>Instead of exposing the queues to clients, you can wrap them with an ordering API. This way, we maintain more control over what’s published in the queue. Wrapping queues have many benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li>We can run validations over the message payload and reject malformed messages with an appropriate error.</li>
<li>We can enrich the message payload with caller information.</li>
<li>We can authenticate callers to control access.</li>
<li>We can implement some of the patterns mentioned below to control fairness in a multi-tenant system and handle surges.</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-06-07/WrapQueues.png" title="‘System diagram for wrapping queues’" ></p>

<p>The downside of wrapping the queues is that we turn an asynchronous call into synchronous. Now our system has to be up to process new messages. We’re trading the availability improvements for more control.</p>

<h3>2. Dealing with a backlog</h3>

<p>The price of increased availability is having to deal with the backlog of messages that occur in a surge or after a failure. One way to do so is by dropping old messages.  When consuming a new message, we can compare the current time with the time the message was published and discard the message if it is greater than some value. Of course, this only works if the systems can tolerate this type of message loss.</p>

<p>Another technique is to move the excess to a spillover queue to be processed later. The system will first work on the new messages on the main queue, and only tackle the ones on the spillover queue once resources are available. This way, we can approximate LIFO order, which might be more appropriate for systems dealing with real-time events.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-06-07/Spillover.png" title="‘Diagram of a system using spillover queue’" ></p>

<p>Finally, we can measure the size of the backlog and scale the number of consumers accordingly. Once the backlog is back to its normal size, we can scale down the consumer instances.</p>

<h3>3. Ensuring fairness</h3>

<p>One of the challenges of having multiple customers is having to guarantee fairness. That is, making sure one client is not exhausting all the available resources, creating significant latencies on other clients’ messages. This is especially true in multi-tenant environments where clients might not be aware they’re sharing resources with other people.</p>

<p>One possible solution is to have different customers publish to different queues, and have the system consume in a round-robin fashion. This is a simple solution, but it does not scale well. If we had thousands of customers, we’d have to manage and poll thousands of queues. Instead, we can have a fixed number of queues and hash each customer to a small number of them. Whenever we receive a message, we retrieve the queues assigned to that customer and put the message on the queue with the shortest backlog. That way, if a client is producing lots of messages on their queues, other workflows are automatically routed to less utilized queues. One caveat worth considering, is that message order is not preserved in this model.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-06-07/Sharding.gif" title="‘Animation of multi-tenant system using sharing’" ></p>

<p>Another solution is to set a rate for messages processed for each customer. Once the customer has gone over the specified rate, messages are put in a spillover queue to be deal with later. This pattern is similar to the one we applied for old messages in the previous section, only in this case we’re using it to prevent one client from exhausting all the processing power.</p>

<h3>3. Ensure enough capacity for surges</h3>

<p>It is crucial to reserve additional resources to be able to handle spikes in traffic. One smart idea is to measure the number of messages retrieved while polling. If the system is retrieving more messages on every poll attempt, it means we probably don’t have enough spare resources to handle a surge.</p>

<h3>4. Updating the visibility timeout</h3>

<p>The way Amazon SQS works is that whenever a consumer receives a message, the message remains on the queue hidden. Other consumers won’t be able to see the message for a period of time known as <em>visibilityTimeout</em>. Once the <em>visibilityTimeout</em> period is up, if the message has not been deleted from the queue, other consumers will be able to get it and process it.</p>

<p>If processing a message is taking too long, we run the risk of going over the <em>visibilityTimeout</em> period. If that happens, another client will receive the message and start churning away, spending more resources on it, even though the first consumer has a better chance of finishing first. To avoid this, when we realize processing is taking too long, we can heartbeat SQS to let it know we’re still working. We do this by updating the <em>visibilityTimeout</em> period for a particular message.</p>

<p>We can also use the ability to programmatically modify the <em>visibilityTimeout</em> for a message to speed up retries. Say our queue is configured with a <em>visibilityTimeout</em> of 10 minutes, and while processing a message, we face a transient error, we can set <em>visibilityTimeout</em> to zero to make it retry faster.</p>

    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/05/09/the-whiteboard-interview-is-broken</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have deluded ourselves into thinking that being able to invert a binary tree on a whiteboard is the hallmark of great software engineering. It’s time we look for better ways of evaluating coding skills.</p>

<!--more-->




<blockquote class="twitter-tweet  tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello, my name is David. I would fail to write bubble sort on a whiteboard. I look code up on the internet all the time. I don&#39;t do riddles.</p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/834146806594433025?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2017</a></blockquote>


<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2>Why whiteboard coding doesn&rsquo;t work</h2>

<p>The whiteboard code interview is a poor predictor of candidate performance because it only focuses on a narrow subset of skills that are rarely used on the day-to-day job. Think about it, when was the last time you had to write a merge sort from scratch and without googling?</p>

<p><strong>Whiteboard coding imposes a set of arbitrary limitations that look nothing like the tasks the candidate will perform once it’s hired. </strong></p>

<p>We make candidates write code on a whiteboard where refactoring is virtually impossible. We don’t allow them to look stuff up on Google or bounce ideas off a teammate. They’re supposed to have all the knowledge required to solve the problem in their head and come up with a good solution on the spot. To make matters worse, they’re placed under an artificial time constraint with the added stress of being watched perform.</p>

<p>At their best whiteboard interviews can testify to a good level of puzzle-solving, some knowledge of data structures, and the ability to retain multiple indexes in your head to simulate a whiteboard code execution. All skills specifically <a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2019/01/10/how-to-prepare-for-the-silicon-valley-interview-part-2/">learned and practiced for the occasion</a>. A whole industry has spawned around helping engineers ace the whiteboard interview: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850">books</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/">platforms</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7a09V1KZo">talks</a>. And don’t get me wrong, they really work!</p>

<p>But whiteboarding fails to test for things that more closely correlate to <em>good</em> software development. It says nothing about whether the candidate can write clean code. It doesn’t tell you if they can navigate a project and introduce changes. If they’re good at refactoring code and working at the right level of abstraction.  If they know how to design and evolve an API. If they’re proficient at troubleshooting and debugging issues. In essence, whiteboarding fails at telling us whether the candidate can write maintainable code that will last longer than the 40 minutes of the typical coding interview.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet  tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.</p>&mdash; Max Howell (@mxcl) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2015</a></blockquote>


<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<h2>Then why do we do it?</h2>

<p>Some would say the whiteboard interview is a rite of passage people need to go through before joining the company. <em>“I went through this experience and did well so the new candidate should do it too”</em>. For the most part, I don’t believe that’s the main reason. I think we just repeat what we’ve seen from other engineers/companies without stopping to think why we do it this way.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know a single engineer that enjoys interviewing. I’d go as far as to say that some of us dread the task. So whenever we’re assigned with evaluating a candidate on their code skills we take the easy way out. We look up some clever interview questions, we study the answers and possible followups, and we roll with it. Thus perpetuating the tradition of whiteboard interviews. To make matters worse, most of the time we are neither trained nor evaluated on how we conduct the interview. And since the impact tends to be long-term and hard to measure people are not really motivated in investing time to improve the process.</p>

<h2>What should we do instead?</h2>

<p><strong>Simple: we should test people in problems and environments as close as possible to what they’ll be doing on the job. </strong></p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://blog.jonrshar.pe/2016/Dec/05/pivotal-interviews.html">Pivotal Labs</a> have the candidate spend a full day pair-programming with the interviewer. No tricky algorithmic puzzle, no whiteboard. A real task at hand and dev-to-dev collaboration.</p>

<p>Another option is to provide a take-home exercise. There’s no artificial time constraint, they can use any 3rd party library and Google whatever they need. Afterward, you can use the submitted code as a starting point for the on-site and ask the candidate to iterate on the solution, either by building a new feature, improving the performance, or working around some limitations.</p>

<p>Yet another option is to give the candidate some code and ask them to refactor it to introduce a new functionality.</p>

<p>One clever thing I&rsquo;ve seen one of my colleagues do at Netflix is to introduce a bug in one of the apps the team maintains, then tell the candidate what users are experiencing and ask them to find the bug and fix it. He assists the candidates with the context needed to understand how the system behaves and nudges them in the right direction if they start going into a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>The ideal scenario, of course, is to have the candidate work with the team for a couple of months before making a decision. That’s why it’s probably easier to hire people already contributing to Open Source projects your company maintains. Unfortunately most of the time this is not really feasible.</p>

<hr />

<p>Improving the coding interview takes time. But it’s hard to think of a better way investment than something that’ll help you hire great software engineers. Hopefully, with time we’ll see fewer and fewer whiteboard interviews.</p>

    <link href="http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/03/13/how-to-create-effective-presentations/"/>
    <updated>2020-03-13T15:17:29-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.github.io/blog/2020/03/13/how-to-create-effective-presentations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a compilation of all the things I learned for creating effective presentations.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The golden rule: <strong>NO BULLET POINTS </strong></h2>

<p>If you can only take one thing from this article let it be this: <em>DO NOT use bullet-points on your slides</em>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a simple reason for this: Humans brains are really dumb. They can’t process spoken and written words at the same time. <strong>People will either read the slides or listen to you, but not both.</strong> And since you’re presenting my guess is you want them paying attention to you. So drop all that extra text so people can focus on what you’re saying.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-04-23/badExample.png" width="600" title="‘Slide with a lot of text’" ></p>

<p>The first step to a bullet-free slide is breaking your content into smaller chunks. <strong>Each slide should focus on a single idea that can be expressed in one or two sentences</strong> (no more than 20 words). Less is more. The rest of the content, the things that you’d normally put in the bullet points, can be spoken. There’s no limit to the number of slides you can use, just make sure you’re only adding the key points on text and speaking the rest.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll soon find out that doing this kind of breakdown is hard. Condensing each topic to a single line takes time. But I promise you, once you do this you’ll be halfway through to creating a great presentation.</p>

<p>Now that you have your central ideas, let&rsquo;s talk about styling. The main goal is to keep it simple so viewers are not distracted. Choose a sans-serif typeface (the ones without the ornaments) and make your text HUGE.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-04-23/serif-vs-sans-serif.jpg" width="400" title="‘Example of serif and sans serif fonts’" ></p>

<p>Big letters are important because everybody in the room should be able to read it, and it’ll help you stay under the 20 words limit. Pick contrasting colors for text and background. You can use <a href="https://colorhunt.co/">Color Hunt</a> to find a cool palette for your deck.  Finally, place the text in the upper left corner. You can add an image or graph if needed, but don’t put something just because you have the space. Make sure it’s meaningful. Keep it short, keep it simple.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-04-23/bigText.png" width="600" title="‘Big text is easier to read’" ></p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>
(Yes, this is the whole slide)
</p>


<h2>The handout</h2>

<p>You might be worried that, by removing text from the slides, people won’t get the full context when going through your deck after the presentation. The solution is to create 2 different artifacts: a presentation and a handout.</p>

<p>All you have to do is move the text from the slides to the presenter notes.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-04-23/presenterNotes.png" width="600" title="‘Handout example’" ></p>

<p>Then, to email your presentation just select <em>Print settings and preview</em> and choose <em>1 slide with notes</em>. Now you have a PDF handout to send after the presentation that includes all the context needed to understand each slide. As a bonus you also get notes you can use while presenting.</p>

<h2>Guiding the audience focus</h2>

<p>Now that we have trimmed the fat from the content it’s time to deal with other sources of distraction. Every single thing not contributing to the message is noise and should go.</p>

<p>First, avoid cluttered templates. They might look cute on page but they can distract the audience.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-04-23/clutteredTemplates.png" width="600" title="‘Example of a slide with a cluttered template’" ></p>

<p>Also, get rid of all the cheese transitions. The only animations you should need is <em>appear </em>and<em> disappear</em> to reveal content as you talk. You can also color and opacity on text or images to guide the audience attention. To achieve this you simply duplicate the slide and apply the appropriate changes.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-04-23/focus.gif" width="600" title="‘Example of using color and opacity to guide audience focus’" ></p>

<p>The only exception to the &ldquo;no animation rule&rdquo; is if your animation is needed to express the slide’s idea. For example, you might animate a pointer to represent the order of execution on a snippet of code, as I did here:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-04-23/animationExample2.gif" title="‘Example of a valid use of animation in a slide’" ></p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>
(I used Magic Move on  Keynote to create this)
</p>


<p>The same rule applies to all other elements of your slide: layout, image size and placement, color, etc. People will infer meaning from all these things, so make sure they’re reinforcing your message and not working against it. For example if you’re talking about three things that happened one after the other align them horizontally and sort them left to right. If you mention a big number make the text big. If you’re comparing two similar things make them the same size and place them side by side. Note how in the “elements of design” slide shown above, the text placement emphasizes the words’ meaning.</p>

<p>Finally, if you have gifs on you presentation, <strong>make sure to stop them after one or two repetitions</strong>. Anything, blinking or moving on the screen is competing with you for attention. <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/prevent-gif-loop">https://davidwalsh.name/prevent-gif-loop</a></p>

<h2>Start with a hook</h2>

<blockquote><p>Humans think in stories, and we try to make sense of the world by telling stories. <em>Yuval Noah Harari</em></p></blockquote>

<p>You know how most presentations start with: &ldquo;My name is Juan and I’m professional turtle trainer, today I’ll talk about depression in turtles“? People already showed up, so they either know who you are or care about the topic you’ll be presenting about, or both. So instead of opening with a boring introduction try using a hook.</p>

<p>Review Start your presentation with a story, a joke or an anecdote related to the topic. Grab the attention of the audience from your first line. Once they’re  hooked in and paying attention you can introduce yourself. You see this all the time on TED talks like this one:</p>

<div style="max-width:600px;margin:30px auto"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>


<h2>Repeat, Repeat, Repeat</h2>

<p>If you want your message to stick <strong>say it multiple times</strong>. The trick to avoid boring your audience is to say the same thing in many different ways. Paraphrase, use an image, present an example or a counter-example, make a rethorical question, use a conversational style… Get creative!</p>

<p>This works because different people prefer different styles of communication. Some of us are more visually inclined, some like specific examples over generalizations, etc. Also, by repeating the mains ideas you’re signaling the audience what’s important. You’re separating the wheat from the chaff. Last but not least, it also works because people get distracted and they might have missed the point the first time.</p>

<p>When possible try to evoke some emotion. As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_First_(book_series)">Head First Series</a> taught us: <em>“brains are tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions”</em>. Share a personal anecdote, make them laugh with a joke or pique their curiosity with a controversial claim and you can guarantee they’ll be paying attention.</p>

<h2>The slides</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go over some of the most common types of slides and how to improve them.</p>

<h3>The title slide</h3>

<p>Most of the time the title slide includes just the title of the talk. Instead, consider providing some context on what’s going to be covered in the presentation as a full sentence. If you’re opening with a hook you can have visuals on your title slide to get right into it.</p>

<h3>The intro slide</h3>

<p>Consider using a blank screen for your introduction. This way you guarantee the attention will be on you and not your slides. Another option is to use a personal photo, related to the topic at hand. Either way, remember that it’s best to open with a hook instead of your introduction.</p>

<h3>The agenda slide</h3>

<p>Most of the time you don&rsquo;t really need an agenda slide. Just jump straight to the content. But if you do include one, make sure you use a small number of sections. Three or four is the sweet spot. You can use images and colors as visual representation of each section.</p>

<h3>The quote slide</h3>

<p>You should have the quote on your slide, only if you’re going to read it word by word. If what you’re saying doesn’t match the text on the screen people will get confused. Another option is to simply blank the screen while reading the quote (here you get to paraphrase if you want).</p>

<h3>The image slide</h3>

<p>When using images go big. Don&rsquo;t worry about breaking the template if you’re using one. Take an empty slide and set the image as background. Don’t put text on it unless you really need to. And if you do use contrasting colors, or place the text over a box with a transparent background to make it readable.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-04-23/imageSlides.png" width="700" title="‘Examples of image slides’" ></p>

<h3>The code slide</h3>

<p>Make sure to use syntax highlighting to make the code more readable. Copy and paste from your favorite IDE or use an online syntax highlighting tool to get a color palette that works with your background.</p>

<p><strong>Remove all boilerplate</strong>. If it’s obvious it can be omitted. For example, if you’re showing  a Java class remove all getters, setters and constructors. Don’t worry if the code on the slide doesn’t really compile. You can include the actual code in the handout or link to a public repo or gist.</p>

<p>If the code has multiple parts you&rsquo;ll be talking about, highlight only the section you’re focusing on and gray out all the rest.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jivimberg.github.io/images/posts/2020-04-23/codeSlide.gif" width="600" title="‘Example of using color and opacity to guide audience focus’" ></p>

<p>Consider using pseudo code so people don&rsquo;t need to be familiar with your language of choice to understand the slide.</p>

<p>Finally, if you like living on the edge and want to do live coding on the stage, you can open your code in full screen on a different workspace and have a separator slide to transition to the editor. Some IDEs have a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ide-viewing-modes.html">presentation mode</a> you can use to make the font huge and remove all other distractions. Just make sure to have a plan B because demos always fail.</p>

<h3>The &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; slide</h3>

<p>Many times this is the slide that stays on screen for the most time. Don’t just write “Thank you” or “Q &amp; A”. Use it to present a summary of the main ideas on your presentation. Make sure to include your social handles in case somebody from the audience wants to reach out to you.</p>

<h2>Bonus: Blanking out the screen</h2>

<p>In this article I mention using an empty slide or blanking out the screen for some sections like the introduction or the quote slide. Having nothing on the screen means all eyes are on you. There’s nothing competing for the audience attention. You’ll be surprised with how well this works.</p>

<p>To achieve this you can either user an empty slide with a black background, or use one of the <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/1696717?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&amp;hl=en">keyboard shortcuts</a> in any part of your presentation.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>We&rsquo;ll build a Bank Account simulation with <em>deposit</em> and <em>withdraw</em> operations exposed through REST endpoints.</p>

<h2>Hexagonal Architecture</h2>

<p>Hexagonal architecture is an architectural style that <strong>focuses on keeping the business logic decoupled from external concerns</strong>.</p>

<p>The business core interacts with other components through ports and adapters. This way, we can change the underlying technologies without having to modify the application core.</p>

<h2>Application Core</h2>

<h3>Domain Model</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the domain model. Its main responsibility is to model the business rules. It also verifies that the objects are always in a valid state:</p>

<p>The domain model should have no dependency on any specific technology. That&rsquo;s the reason why you&rsquo;ll find no Spring annotations here.</p>

<h3>Ports</h3>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to have our business logic interact with the outside world. To achieve this, we&rsquo;ll introduce some ports.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s define 2 incoming ports. <strong>These are used by external components to call our application</strong>. In this case, we&rsquo;ll have one per use case. One for <em>Deposit</em>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>DepositUseCase.java </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">DepositUseCase</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">deposit</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Long</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">BigDecimal</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And one for <em>Withdraw</em>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>WithdrawUseCase.java </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">WithdrawUseCase</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">withdraw</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Long</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">BigDecimal</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Similarly, we&rsquo;ll also have 2 outgoing ports. <strong>These are for our application to interact with the database</strong>. Once again, we&rsquo;ll have one per use case. One for <em>Loading</em> the Account:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>LoadAccountPort.java </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">LoadAccountPort</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">Optional</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">BankAccount</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">load</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Long</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And one for <em>Saving</em> it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>SaveAccountPort.java </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">SaveAccountPort</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">save</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">BankAccount</span> <span class="n">bankAccount</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Service</h3>

<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll create a service to tie all the pieces together and drive the execution:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>BankAccountService.java </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note how the service implements the incoming ports. On each method, it uses the <em>Load</em> port to fetch the account from the database. Then, it performs the changes on the domain model. And finally, it saves those changes through the <em>Save</em> port.</p>

<h2>Adapters</h2>

<h3>Web</h3>

<p>To complete our application, we need to provide implementations for the defined ports. We call these adapters.</p>

<p>For the incoming interactions, we&rsquo;ll create a REST controller:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>BankAccountController.java </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="nd">@RestController</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nd">@RequestMapping</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/account&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">BankAccountController</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">DepositUseCase</span> <span class="n">depositUseCase</span><span class="o">;</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="c1">// Constructor</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nd">@PostMapping</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;/{id}/deposit/{amount}&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">deposit</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nd">@PathVariable</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">Long</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nd">@PathVariable</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">BigDecimal</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</span><span class='line'>      <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The controller uses the defined ports to make calls to the application core.</p>

<h3>Persistence</h3>

<p>For the persistence layer, we&rsquo;ll use Mongo DB through Spring Data:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>SpringDataBankAccountRepository.java </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">SpringDataBankAccountRepository</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">MongoRepository</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">BankAccount</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Long</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Also, we&rsquo;ll create a <em>BankAccountRepository</em> class that connects the outgoing ports with the <em>SpringDataBankAccountRepository</em>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>BankAccountRepository.java </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h3>Infrastructure</h3>

<p>Finally, we need to tell Spring to expose the <em>BankAccountService</em> as a bean, so it can be injected in the controller:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>BeanConfiguration.java </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>      <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Defining the beans in the Adapters layer helps us maintain the infrastructure code decoupled from the business logic.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ve seen how to implement an application using Hexagonal Architecture and Spring Boot. This is what the system ends up looking like:</p>
