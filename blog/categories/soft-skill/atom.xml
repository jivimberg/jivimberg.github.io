    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might think that being a backend engineer means you’ll never have to draw anything more complex than a bunch of boxes connected with arrows (or hexagons if are going all cloud native). This is simply not true, and that’s why you’re here.</p>

<p>At some point you’ll find yourself producing system diagrams, flow-charts, slides, mockups, maybe even icons! So, let me show you some tools and tricks I picked up over the years to fake it at design.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Hand-draw images</h2>

<p>Maybe you noticed that some of the drawings that I use on this website look like they where done by a 5 year old. Like this one:</p>

<p><a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2019/02/23/sqs-consumer-using-kotlin-coroutines/">{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/consumerDiagram.png  800 ‘A hand drawing’ %}</a></p>

<p>I create these using <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/onenote/digital-note-taking-app">Microsoft’s OneNote</a> on my wife’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-5th-gen/8nkt9wttrbjk?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Surface Pro</a>. The app it’s somewhat basic, but it does one key thing: it lets you select your traces, move them around and scale them with simple gestures. And that’s really alI you need.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/surfacePro.jpg  600 ‘Drawing on a SurfacePro’ %}</p>

<p>Also you can drop any kind of file to OneDrop and draw on top of it.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/meFramed.png  200 ‘A doodle on my face’ %}</p>

<p>But, as I said, the Surface Pro is not mine, so I don’t get to take it to work. At the office I use a low-tech alternative: a <strong><a href="https://getrocketbook.com/">Rocketbook</a></strong>. It’s a notebook you can erase with water.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/rocketbook.gif ‘Rocketbook animation’ %}</p>

<p>The pages are from a plasticky material, but it feels pretty close to drawing on actual paper. And you get karma points for not needing dead trees to do your half-ass doodles.</p>

<p>The best thing is that it comes with an app that allows you to scan your drawings and configure an action based on an icon you mark on the page. This helps me digitalize all my notes in a breeze. I can sketch something quickly, take out my phone and share it in Slack in 2 seconds, and without having to shell out $1k for an iPad.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/slack.png ‘Slack conversation with drawing’ %}</p>

<p>My only complain is that you have to wait a couple of minutes for the pages to dry when you’re cleaning it. So cleaning the whole book might take you 15 or 20 minutes. But I only do this once a month so it’s not that big of a deal for me.</p>

<h2>System diagrams and Flowcharts</h2>

<p>Let’s face it, most of your diagrams will still be boxes, cylinders and stick-figures. You don’t want your wiki page or slides including an image like this:</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/ugly-whiteboard.png  400 ‘Whiteboard image that looks ugly’ %}</p>

<p>Why not do it with style? Meet <strong><a href="https://whimsical.com">Whimsical</a></strong>. With this tool you’ll be able to spit beautiful diagrams in seconds. It’s deceptively simple. It has smart snap to grip and auto-grouping that at times feels like it’s reading your mind.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/whimsical.gif 800 ‘Whimsical demo’ %}</p>

<p>It can do flowcharts, mind maps, wireframes and sticky notes. The catch is you only get 4 <em>“boards”</em> for free. After that it’s $10 a month💰</p>

<p>If you don’t feel like paying you can always use <a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io</a>. It has Google Drive integration, and a wide variety of shapes for different types of diagrams (Flow-chars, UML, BPMN, etc).</p>

<p>Use the comic style to get your diagrams to look like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2018/07/03/writing-githooks-in-kotlin/">{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/drawio.png  ‘Draw.io example’ %} </a></p>

<p><em>(This diagram is from my <a href="https://jivimberg.io/blog/2018/07/03/writing-githooks-in-kotlin/">“Writing Githooks in Kotlin”</a> post)</em></p>

<p>If all you’re trying to create is a UML of your existing code then you should check <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/class-diagram.html">this Intellij feature</a> that gives you just that in a couple clicks.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/intellijUML.png 600 ‘UML diagram from Intellij’ %}</p>

<p>Similarly if you’re using Spring you can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/spring-support.html">get a beans dependencies diagram</a> just as easily.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/beans-dependencies.png 600 ‘Beans dependencies diagram on Intellij’ %}</p>

<h2>Sharing snippets of code</h2>

<p>If you need to share a snippet of code you can create a Gist like this one: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jivimberg/8cae46cdb5b98c0d19176efcde2eadd9">sendForm.gs</a>. And you can easily embed them in a page:</p>

<p>{% gist 8cae46cdb5b98c0d19176efcde2eadd9 %}</p>

<p>Gist are great because they have version history, can be commented, forked and starred and you can group multiple files in a single Gist.</p>

<p>If you happen to be working with Kotlin you can also use <a href="https://play.kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin Playground</a>, this way you also get the ability to execute the code. Here is <a href="https://pl.kotl.in/_h-DbUrtj">an example</a>. You can also embed them as well, or better yet, <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2018/04/embedding-kotlin-playground/">include Kotlin playground as a script in your page</a> and have all your code blocks converted to runnable snippets.</p>

<h2>Presentations</h2>

<p>I’ve used a lot of <a href="https://prezi.com"><strong>Prezis</strong></a> in the past. If you’ve never seen a Prezi think a giant canvas where you drop stuff, and each slide is basically zooming to a different portion of the canvas. Here’s an example of a Prezi I did about the things I learned from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/gamification">Coursera’s gamification course</a> by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~226710">Kevin Werbach</a>.</p>

<iframe id="iframe_container" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" width="550" height="400" src="https://prezi.com/embed/uyg0exmhwbrn/?bgcolor=ffffff&amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;autohide_ctrls=0&amp;landing_data=bHVZZmNaNDBIWnNjdEVENDRhZDFNZGNIUE43MHdLNWpsdFJLb2ZHanI5dkNTakxDRmJwb3czakswMFhxZHJkNGtRPT0&amp;landing_sign=YH6jqN1LpGyTSh-ze0MNsqdGvDrfivc-HRxIPrpG7H8"></iframe>


<p>It’s an awesome tool that adds a world of possibilities to your presentations. But, with time I understood that just throwing cool transitions doesn’t make your presentation that much better. As any good designer knows, <a href="https://material.io/design/motion/#principles">animations need to serve a purpose</a>. Prezi works best when you use its zooming effects to reinforce the ideas you’re trying to communicate, or to use the canvas layout so that viewers get a good sense on how the content is organized. If you combine this tools in a meaningful way you can create amazing presentations <a href="https://prezi.com/mgujrvianlqb/virtual-tour-ceva-logistics/">like this one</a>.</p>

<p>This days, though, if I need to throw a deck together quickly, I hit <a href="https://www.slidescarnival.com/"><strong>Slides Carnivals</strong></a>. I pick a template that matches the topic I’m covering, import it in Google Slides and start working on it. Only if I need some fancy animations I’d use Keynote (see next topic).</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/slidesCarnival.png 800  ‘Slides carnival’ %}</p>

<p>Finally,  it doesn’t really matter which tools you use if you’re just going to cramp 3 paragraphs of text in a slide. And no, having bullet points doesn’t make it any better.  You need to <a href="https://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/">give your deck some ❤️</a>. But  that’s a topic for another day.</p>

<h2>Animations</h2>

<p>Animations can be super useful to visualize complex concepts. Specially on the backend world where much of our work consists of translating the mental model we have of the system into code. Creating visual cues, like animations, helps us communicate our intent in an unambiguous way.</p>

<p>Don’t believe me? Try explaining how the <a href="https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.channels/index.html">different kinds of Kotlin channels</a> behave using just words. Then check this animation:</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-04-18/Channels.gif  600 ‘Channels animation’ %}</p>

<p>You can create simple animations like this one 👆 on <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a></strong>. Using <em>Magic move</em> and playing around with the order you can create all kind of choreographed animations. When you’re satisfied with the result, <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH28038?locale=en_US&amp;viewlocale=en_US">you can export your creation as a gif</a> and share it with the world.</p>

<h2>UI Mocks</h2>

<p>If you ever worked with non-tech people you know the importance of showing something. Just telling them about what a system will do or how it would look it’s not enough. They have to see it 👀. That’s why low-res mockups are so powerful. You can use a tool like <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> to create something like this in minutes. And you can even make them interactive to show how different screens would connect to each other.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/balsamiq.png 600 ‘balsamic example’ %}</p>

<p>Whimsical also has wire-framing capabilities:</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/whimsical-wireframe.png ‘Whimsical wireframe’ %}</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something more high-res checkout <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com">InVision</a>, that’s what all the cool kids are using this days.</p>

<h2>Logos, banners and more</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.canva.com">Canva</a></strong> is probably the <strong>best design tools for non-designers</strong> you’ll find online, hands down.  I’ve used it for all kind of things. I’ve used it to create logos:</p>

<p>{% img center /images/posts/2019-06-18/Kassette.png 250 ‘Logo created in Canva’ %}</p>

<p>And much, much more… Seriously, if you’ve never used it just go and check it out because it’s amazing, and super simple to use.</p>

<h2>Icons</h2>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-generic.html">Icon generator</a>, part of the <a href="https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html">Android Asset Studio</a> tools put together by <a href="https://roman.nurik.net/">@Romanurik</a>. Specially if you’re doing something on Android.</p>

<h2>Bonus tips</h2>

<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Searching Google Images for some fancy image to drop into your diagram? Add <code>filetype:png</code> to your search to filter for PNG images. Also, make use the search tools to filter by color, size and license type!</p>

<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> <strong><code>⌘ + Shift + 5</code></strong>. Screenshot everything. Screenshot your code in the IDE, screenshot multiple frames from a video and turn it into a gif, screenshot your drawings when the app you’re using doesn’t export to image (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-onenote/how-do-i-export-a-onenote-2013-page-as-an-image/825a08e3-f6c4-4d14-9e3e-c1ec54eb7b99?auth=1">I’m looking at you OneNote</a>). For example, for this post I wanted to create the photo border effect on my picture up there 👆. I knew Keynote had such effect but it’s not meant for image editing. So what did I do? I created a new slide with white background, drop my image, added the desired effect, <em>⌘ + Shift + 5 </em>, and voila! I know it’s hacky, but it gets the work done!</p>

<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Befriend graphic designers. Ask them what tools they use. Watch them work. Take note on how they dress.</p>

    <updated>2018-09-30T11:28:59-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jivimberg.io/blog/2018/09/30/book-recommendations-radical-candor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I finished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01MY574EE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538332470&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=radical+candor">Radical Candor</a> a book by <a href="https://www.kimmalonescott.com/">Kim Scott</a> about <em>how to be a good boss without being an asshole</em>. Here’s what I learned.</p>

<!--more-->




<iframe type="text/html" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="margin: auto; display: block; max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B01KTIEFEE&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_IcxSBbZDBE91M" ></iframe>


<h1>1.  Be honest. Specially when it’s hard</h1>

<p>{% blockquote Kim Scott, Radical Candor %}</p>

<p>“From the time we learn to speak, we’re told that if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all. When you become a manager, it’s your job to say it&ndash;and your obligation.”</p>

<p>{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>If somebody’s work is subpar and you let it pass and pretend is good, <strong>you’re doing everybody a disservice</strong>. You’re hurting the team because either you or somebody else, will have to cover up for the guy and redo the work. And at the same time you’re setting a precedent that it is OK to deliver poor work.</p>

<p>But even more importantly <strong>you’re not giving that person the chance to improve by pointing out what he/she needs to work on!</strong> So if you care about your team, speak up! Be <em>honest</em>, be <em>direct</em> and be <em>specific</em>.</p>

<h1>2. How to be direct without being a dick</h1>

<p>Kim’s advise is to <em>care personally™</em>, which to me means: <strong>care for the other person, but seriously</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s not enough to remember you employees partner’s name, or to ask about his hobbies every now and then. To make radical candor work you have to build and actual relationship with your direct reports. Get to know them. <strong>Understand where they come from and what drives them</strong>.</p>

<p>So, how to put this in practice? The book has a ton of useful <strong>tips on how to criticize without discouraging</strong>. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Start by asking for feedback before giving it</strong>. Show that you’re open to criticism and make sure you reward people that takes the time and effort to correct you. This is the only way you can build of culture of radical candor.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t make it personal</strong>. When pointing out things that can be improved make it clear that it’s not about the person but about the work done. Be specific! And present it as an opportunity for improvement and <em>offering help and guidance to fix the problem</em>.</li>
</ol>


<h1>3. Not everybody is looking for  a promotion</h1>

<p>This one is about how we value and judge ambition. As the book points out <strong>not everybody on your team is eager to jump to a new position or wants to be a manager</strong>. You’ll probably have some team members that are content with their current position and, for whatever reason, are not looking for a change. And that’s ok!</p>

<p>The book calls this people <em>”Rockstars”</em> because they are the rock that brings stability to the team. An uses the term <em>“Superstars”</em> for the more ambitious kind that are looking for new opportunities to shine. I think the names are stupid. But what’s not stupid is the realization that <strong>you need both kinds of people in your team</strong>.</p>

<p>If your team is only composed of <em>”Superstars”</em> then if they succeed (and it’s your job to help them succeed!) then you’ll end up without team because everybody has moved to a new thing. On the other hand if your team is all <em>“Rockstars”</em> then you run the risk of stagnation as you’ll lack your main agents of innovation. You’ll need to get the right mix of <em>“Rockstars”</em> and <em>“Superstars”</em> for your team to be successful.</p>

<p>It’s worth pointing out that <strong>this “labels” are not permanent</strong>. People will move between the two kinds based on their priorities, values and things on their personal life. And it’s your job as manager to figure out what each team member is aiming for, and help them get there.</p>

<p>Remember that promotions are just one way of recognizing people’s work, and it might not be the best reward for everybody.</p>

<h1>4. On culture</h1>

<p>I found quite interesting the observation that, when left unchecked, <strong>the team’s culture tends to reflect it’s leaders strengths and short-comings</strong>. Kim explains  how every action, big or small, has an impact on the team culture. So for example, if you’re working on improving the product quality and attention to detail you shouldn’t send emails with spelling mistakes. <strong>You have to lead by example and inspire people to follow</strong>.</p>

<p>The only way of creating a long-lasting culture is by inspiring people and letting them contribute with their own ideas.</p>

<hr />

<p>I’m just scratching the surface here. The book expands on the mentioned topics with good real-world examples. The second portion of the book focuses on the details on how to put the theory in practice. It covers from things like <em>how to schedule and conduct your one-on-ones</em> to <em>hiring techniques to avoid biases</em>. <strong>So go read it!</strong> I’m sure you’ll find something useful.</p>
