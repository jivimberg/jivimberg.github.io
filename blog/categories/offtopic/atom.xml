    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are billions of blogs written by more experienced and talented devs, there is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> and communities for each tool and language ever created, so why bother creating yet another dev blog? Here are the two reasons why I started this blog.</p>

<p>The first reason why I chose to get my hands dirty writing this pages is that I&rsquo;m like the Memento guy trying to code. Whatever code I&rsquo;m working on today will seem completely new for me next month. So one day I had an idea, what if I could have a place where I would go back and check my notes and snippets of the things I learned. There&rsquo;s a phrase that goes: <em>&ldquo;To know I read, to learn I do, to understand I teach&rdquo;</em>. So even in theory the process of thinking how to write about something is helping me remember it.</p>

<p>And the second reason is that I&rsquo;ve been using online resources for so long that I&rsquo;m starting to feel that it&rsquo;s affecting my karma for not contributing back. So here are my two cents. Hopefully someone will find it useful.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
