<h3>Begin with praise and honest appreciation</h3>

<p>It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points. This is also sometimes refered as the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/297247/give-constructive-criticism">&ldquo;sandwich rule&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-06-15/SandwichRule.jpg" width="250" title="'Sandwich Rule'" ></p>

<h3>How to Criticize: Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly</h3>

<p>Change the word &lsquo;but&rsquo; to &lsquo;and&rsquo;. For example: a man carefully polished a sermon and showed it to his wife, instead of talking about its many faults, she said she thought it would be a great article for some journal. Be subtle about criticism.</p>

<h3>Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing</h3>

<p>In order to build rapport with the person you are criticising, start by talking about your own mistakes. You can use phrases like: &ldquo;When I was your age, I too struggled with&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;When I was at your level of experience, I too thought that&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Ask questions instead of giving direct orders</h3>

<p>Gave suggestions, not orders. Let people do things for themselves and make their own mistakes. Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. <strong>People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.</strong></p>

<h3>Let the other person save face</h3>

<p>A few minutes’ thought, a considerate word or two, or a genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude can go a long way to alleviating the sting of criticism. Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said: <em>“I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.”</em></p>

<h3>Praise every improvement, no matter how slight</h3>

<p>Take every chance you&rsquo;ve got to sincerly praise someone. Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere – not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good. <strong>Nobody wants flattery!</strong></p>

<h3>Give the person a fine reputation to live up to</h3>

<p>In short, if you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics. Give them a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.</p>

<h3>Make a fault seem easy to correct</h3>

<p>Make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it – and he will practise until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.</p>

<h3>Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest</h3>

<p>When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit. <em>&lsquo;He had a delightful way of putting things; he created the impression that by accepting this great honour I would be doing him a favour.&rsquo;</em></p>
