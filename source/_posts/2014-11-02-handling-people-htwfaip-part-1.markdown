###1. Don't criticize condemn or complain###
Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.

###2. Give sincere and honest appreciation###
Everyone wants to feel important. We usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise. Think of the other person’s good points, so you won’t have to resort to flattery. Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. 

###3. Arouse in the other person an eager want###
 Talk about what they want and show them how to get it. Henry Ford: “If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
