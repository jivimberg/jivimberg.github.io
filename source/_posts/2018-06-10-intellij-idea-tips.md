Here are a couple of **IntelliJ IDEA** shortcuts and configurations I wish Iâ€™d known sooner.

<!--more-->

## 1. Changing the default font

The **first** thing I do every time I have to configure a new installation of IntelliJ is setting the theme to _Darcula_.

{% img center /images/posts/2018-06-10/Darcula.png 720 â€™Darcula themeâ€™ %}

The **second** thing I do is **changing the font** to [Fira Code][1], and **enabling font ligatures.** Hereâ€™s how it looks like:

{% img center /images/posts/2018-06-10/FiraCodeExample.png 720 â€™Fira code exampleâ€™ %}

You can enable this from `Settings` \> `Editor` \> `Font`. Make sure to check `Enable font ligatures` if you like that `â‰ ` symbol.

## 2. Auto-reformat

If youâ€™re one of those developers that is obsessively hitting `âŒ¥â‡§âŒ˜L`  to get your code reformatted on every keystroke then **Iâ€™m about to change your life**. 

First install the **[Save actions][2]** plugin. Now open `Settings` \> `Other settings` \> `Save actions`, in there select: 

* `Activate save actions on save`
* `Reformat file`
* And customize any other inspection and quick fix to your liking

{% img center /images/posts/2018-06-10/saveActions.png 720 â€™Save actions settingsâ€™ %}

Now your can just spit your _ugly_ code and **itâ€™ll get perfectly formatted on each save**. _Nice uh?_

## 3. Extend selection

This is not a configuration, but one of my **favorite shortcuts**. I learned this from a [talk][3] by [Hadi Hariri][4]. 

What is it for? Paraphrasing the [IntelliJ blog][5]:

> Structural selection allows you to select expressions based on grammar. By pressing `âŒ¥â†‘` you keep expanding your selection (starting from the caret). And vice versa, you can shrink it by pressing `âŒ¥â†“`.[^1]

Here you can see it in action:

Just mentioning this one because it was new to me at the time and nowadays I find myself using it **all the time!**

## Have any IntelliJ tip to share? Iâ€™d love to know about it! **Post a comment** down here ðŸ‘‡
