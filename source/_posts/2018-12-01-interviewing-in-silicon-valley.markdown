# Low-risk interviews

As with most things in life **you have to try and fail in order to get better**. There is no other way around it.

I have to confess; at first I was terrified about doing interviews. It had been almost 5 years since the last time I interviewed back in Argentina. Fortunately, my friend [Luketua][1][^1] was there to give me a great piece of advice: _do low-risk interviews_. 

__One of the fastest ways of conquering fear is by JUST DOING the thing you fear__ (the second ride on a rollercoaster is not as scary, right?). So take that first step! Pick a company you find interesting, but _it's not your first choice_ and schedule an interview. Even if you _completely_ screw up you will at least have the experience of having gone through it, so the second time won't be as scary. Maybe you'll even learn which topics you need to focus your practice. Just go for it, __you've got nothing to lose__.

# The on-site routine

This is the routine I came up with for the on-sites:

Mindfulness is something I‚Äôve just recently discovered. I was introduced to it through the book [Waking Up][3] and have started practicing meditation using the [Headspace][4] app. I usually did a **15/20 minutes meditation before the on-site** and found that it helped me relax before going in.

# Your perception is __not__ predictive of performance

This is something I heard first at this [Silicon Valley Code Camp talk][5]. If you start to feel the interview is going south, don't panic! __Just keep going.__ It might be that you were given a hard question, in which case you might not be expected to arrive at an optimal solution in the given time (and in any case, all other candidates will probably struggle through the same question). Or maybe you sense your interviewer is impatient or annoyed. Don't assume it's because of your performance, maybe he's having a bad day, or that's just his personality. The point is, __you just don't know__. Here it is in Gayle's own words (the whole talk is really worth it):

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8T7a09V1KZo?start=3454" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Of course, I learned this _the hard way_. On one of my on-sites I was struggling with an exercise that looked trivial to me. I ended up arriving at a solution with some help from the interviewer, only to give the wrong answer when asked about the time complexity. To make things worst I was not able to come up with any good improvements to my solution. I was sweating bullets and had to fight the urge of escaping from the interview. Imagine my surprise when, on my way home, I received an email saying that I made it to the next step of the process. __Bottomline: You don't know how you're doing. Just keep going.__

# Interviews are a two-way street

One thing to always keep in mind is that interviews are a two-way street: __you're evaluating the company as much as they're evaluating you__. This is your best chance to learn about _the company_, _the role_, _the culture_ and _your future teammates_, so don't miss it! 

Here are some of the questions I like to ask: 

* How do you __prioritize__ tasks? How do you __make decisions__? How do you __handle interruptions__? (Ask about hot bugs, devops, CI/CD, etc.)
* What do you __like the most__ about working for this company?
* What's one thing __the team should improve on__?
* What's on the __roadmap__ for the team?

And don't play it safe. __If there's something that is a red flag for your just be direct and ask about it__. After all, you're better off knowing things in advance, and you give the interviewer a chance to clarify on the issue. For example __I asked one company why they were using an outdated stack and another one about the recent articles regarding its toxic culture__. As long as you're polite about it nobody is going to get pissed off.

# Rejections

Rejections are just part of the interview process. If you're not being rejected, you're probably _not interviewing enough_. The golden rule to handle rejections is: __don't take it personally__. 

The second rule is: __always ask for feedback__. Once I was applying for this startup that made me do a take-home exercise. I spent the best part of my weekend working on it. First I _solved_ the problem, then I _tested_ the code, then I _refactored_ everything nicely into easy to read functions, then I added some more tests and even _documented_ them using [ASCII graphs][6] (for real). When I sent my submission on Sunday __I was honestly hoping the company would be so impressed they would realize there was no need for an on-site__. Two days later I got an email: _"...we have decided to move forward with another candidate..."_ üò¢. So with my ego hurt, I decided to answer back asking what I did wrong. __Turns out my code performance sucked!__ In an effort to make the code super readable I had utterly destroyed performance. __Needless to say I never made the same mistake again.__

# The follow-up

The obvious thing to do after an interview is to follow-up with a thank you email. Now, __the _smart_ thing to do is to follow-up with questions__. During the interview you'll get a glimpse of what the company is working on, you'll learn about what technologies they use, and how their systems are designed. Naturally, you'll have lots of questions that you didn't get to ask during the interview, either because of time constraints or because they didn't occur to you at the time (if you don't then _maybe you're not really that interested in what the company is doing_). __Now is the time to ask!__ Make sure to include them in your follow-up email along with any other comment that comes to mind.

__Pro-tip:__ Use [Google alerts][7] to set notifications for new content about the company, so you'll always know what they're up to. This way I learned that the CEO of one of the companies I was interviewed for was a guest in a podcast and got to ask him about some of the topics he talked about afterward.

# The offer

This is how a typical offer might be structured:

{% img center /images/posts/2018-12-22/compensation1.png 750 ‚ÄòThe on-site routine‚Äô %}

To __compare competing offers__ you'll want to get the yearly compensation so:

{% img center /images/posts/2018-12-22/compensation2.png 750 ‚ÄòThe on-site routine‚Äô %}

If you want to be thorough, you should also consider the __vesting period__ as well as financial benefits such as __matching 401k__ and __employee stock option plans__.

Startup offers are trickier to evaluate because of the _risk factor_ involved. __If you're applying for a startup, and your offer includes equity I suggest you read [this guide][8].__

Finally here's a list of things you should take into account (other than compensation) when evaluating an offer:

* Who are you going to be working with?
* Do you find the problems challenging and exciting?
* What kind of things you'll learn at this role?
* What's the company's culture?
* How is the company doing and what's its growth projection?
* How this role will look on your resume?
* How are the offices? And how long is the commute?
* What kind of benefits and perks does the company offer?

# Bonus track: Advice potpourri

* __Smile!__ Try to enjoy the process.
* The interview is not over until the interviewer says so. Until then, keep solving, improving and testing your solution.
* Try to schedule the final round of interviews as close to each other as possible. Some people like to take a week off and do all the on-sites that week.
* You don't have to answer how much you're making in your current job. In some states (CA included) [it's even illegal to ask][9].
* __Don't give up after rejection!__ Companies always let you re-apply after some time. I know a guy that got accepted at Google on his 4th attempt.
