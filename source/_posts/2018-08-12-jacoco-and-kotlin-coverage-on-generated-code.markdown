JaCoCo works _flawlessly_ with Kotlin. Except when it reports lines not covered on generated code ðŸ˜¡. Fortunately thereâ€™s a fix already in place.

{% blockquote Me, Every time I saw the coverage report %}
What!? I didnâ€™t even write those functions! Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m writing tests for them. Iâ€™m pretty sure the compiler knows what itâ€™s doingâ€¦
{% endblockquote %}

Good news is that this [has been fixed][1] in the latest JaCoCo release (thanks to [goodwink][2]). Bad news is that **0.8.2 is not out yet** ðŸ˜ž

If you are like me, and canâ€™t wait to get this working, you can **use the SNAPSHOT version of JaCoCo** making this changes on your `build.gradle`:

{% codeblock lang:kotlin %}
repositories {
	â€¦
	maven("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots")
}

jacoco {
	toolVersion = "0.8.2-SNAPSHOT"
}

{% endcodeblock %}

_(Iâ€™m using [Gradle with Kotlin DSL][3] in this example)_

Now you can finally take your Kotlin coverage to 100% without having to write tests for `component1()` and `component2()`.
