The weird thing is I can write Javascript code if needed (and I’ve done indeed), but at the same time I feel I know nothing about the language itself. In an attempt of making my first formal introduction to the language I’ve put together this article.  

<!--more-->

## Objects, no classes

## Functions are first class citizens
// Show how functions are used in javascript
// Compare it with Java 7 and 8 lambda expressions

## The ‘this’ keyword 
// play around with it a little bit and show what call does. 

## Inheritance and prototype

## About constructors

// Why is the **new** syntax not recommended? See [this SO question][1]
