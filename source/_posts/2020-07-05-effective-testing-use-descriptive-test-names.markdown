Picking good test names can help us identify what's wrong with our code when something fails.

<!--more-->

It's Friday afternoon. You finally finished that long refactor youâ€™ve been working on for the whole week. Everything is looking good. Except you run the tests and see one failure.

{% img center /images/posts/2020-07-05/BadNames.png â€˜Test output with bad test namesâ€™ %}

<p style='text-align: center; font-size: 42px;'>
ðŸ¤”
</p>

Unfortunately, **you can't really tell what's broken from looking at that output**. Youâ€™ll have to browse the test code to identify the failure. 

But what if the output looked more like this:

{% img center /images/posts/2020-07-05/GoodNames.png â€˜Test output with good test namesâ€™ %}

Now the issue is obvious. **You can immediately tell which part of the code is not working and what the output should be.**

Test names are the first (and often only) piece of information we see about a test. Using a descriptive test name can help us identify whatâ€™s broken at a glance. Furthermore, it helps us keep the test focused on validating one specific behavior, discouraging us from inflating the test with other unrelated assertions. 

## How

Instead of just using the name of the method being tested, try focusing on the behavior you want to validate. **Describe the state of the system, the action performed, and the expected output.** More often than not, youâ€™ll end up with a huge name, something you probably wouldnâ€™t use on production code, but thatâ€™s ok.

If you're using Kotlin, you can [use backticks to have whitespaces in your function name][1]. If youâ€™re working with [JUnit][2] you can leverage the [`@DisplayName`][3] annotation for prettier names. You can even get emojis in there:

You can also write a custom name generator using `@DisplayNameGeneration` [as shown here][4]. 

Some testing libraries like [Kotest][5], also [support nesting tests][6]:

You can read more about test naming in Chapter 12 of [Software Engineering at Google][7].
