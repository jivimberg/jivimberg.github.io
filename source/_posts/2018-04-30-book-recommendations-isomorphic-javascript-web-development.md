I finally got around to finish the new book my friend and colleague [@talabes][1] wrote and I think it’s great. Here’s why.

☝That’s me every single time I try to start a _simple_ web project. If you are like me, not a full-time front-end developer, you probably know what I’m talking about (if not check **[this article][2]** and try not to choke on your cereal laughing).

I found [Tomas’ book][3] to be the perfect cure against [decision paralysis][4] in the world of JavaScript web development. His approach is practical and concise: 

> _“Here’s the **stack** we are using. This is how you **set it up** and this is a **basic example** of what we’re trying to achieve. If you want to go deeper go and read this.”[^1]_

From **testing** and **bundling** to **routing** and **security** this book goes through all the topics a developer needs to know, with easy-to-follow examples and useful tips _”from-the trenches”_. It serves as a **comprehensive guide**, covering all the things we need to consider to get our application up and running.

Finally, I love that the book answers **common questions** that sometimes other introductory material gloss over. Things like: _”how do I structure my project?”_ or _”how can I troubleshoot and debug this thing?”_.

Curious? Take a quick look:
